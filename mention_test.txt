Well , what in fact was the content of that SMS ?++++++47++++++
Let 's take a look via this footage , ha .++++++48++++++
I remember the SMS was written like this at that time , saying that , ah , there was a sewage pipe leakage accident on the side road at the southeast corner of Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road , and , well , traffic supervision was implemented near Chaoyang Road , Jingguang Bridge , and East Third Ring Road , and requesting cars to make a detour .the southeast corner of Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road	29|40

++++++49++++++
Some car owners said that it was very good that the SMS was sent .that it was very good that the SMS was sent	4|14
++++++50++++++
Furthermore , there was one last sentence in that SMS thanking citizens for their cooperation and support .for their cooperation and support	12|17
++++++51++++++
Ah , after the SMS was sent , , I felt it seems to be the first time that Beijing Municipality , ah , used an SMS to give notification at the time of a public emergency .after the SMS was sent ,	2|8

I do n't know , all of us are living in Beijing , is this the first time , Professor Zhou ?the first time , Professor Zhou	15|21

++++++54++++++
Uh-huh .++++++55++++++
Of course , in private life , people have used SMS countless times to spread news .++++++56++++++
Yes .++++++57++++++
Other places in the country must have used this too .++++++58++++++
Uh-huh , uh-huh .++++++59++++++
Must have used this too .++++++60++++++
Actually , I remember receiving an SMS like this one last year before it snowed , since snowfall would affect road conditions in Beijing to a rather large extent .to a rather large extent	24|29
++++++61++++++
Uh-huh .++++++62++++++
However , it did not give people such a special feeling as it did this time .++++++63++++++
Uh-huh .++++++64++++++
Ah , when an SMS is sent to inform citizens of such an incident , can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ?expression of government information transparency	23|28
to inform citizens of such an incident	7|14
++++++65++++++
Yes , this is indeed through the very successful response to this emergency , ah , by Beijing Municipality , Uh-huh . an extremely good point that is worth pondering deeply , worthy innovation .the very successful response to this emergency	6|13
through the very successful response to this emergency	5|13
++++++66++++++
Uh-huh .++++++67++++++
For instance , previously our news announcements were made through some conventional methods , but this time it was made in the form of a mobile phone SMS .the form of a mobile phone SMS	21|28
through some conventional methods	9|13
in the form of a mobile phone SMS	20|28

In fact , this is a method highly emphasized in various countries ' development of e-government .various countries ' development of e-government	10|16

++++++69++++++
We usually make it sound like e-government is something unattainable .like e-government is something unattainable	5|10
++++++70++++++
Yes , when we talked about e-government in the past , it seemed to be only done through the Internet .through the Internet	17|20
++++++71++++++
Right .++++++72++++++
It seemed that computers , ah , and the Internet , ah , were an expression of e-government , to let people find out information .that computers , ah , and the Internet , ah , were an expression of e-government , to let people find out information	2|25
++++++73++++++
Well , presently in fact , e-governments in various countries apply this so - called last multiple - exposure method , such as call centers , such as electronic IDs , and such as , these electronic signatures .in fact	3|5
++++++74++++++
These are quite sophisticated forms .quite sophisticated forms	2|5
++++++75++++++
Uh-huh .++++++76++++++
In particular , more terminals , such as , this cable television , ah , , this digital television , ah , and mobile phone SMS , are applied in e-government .In particular	0|2
more terminals , such as , this cable television , ah , , this digital television , ah , and mobile phone SMS ,	3|27
++++++77++++++
Hence , I think this is , a test of e-government because , as I remember , during SARS in 2003 , people at that time criticized e-government during the spread of SARS , ah .this is , a test of e-government because , as I remember , during SARS in 2003 , people at that time criticized e-government during the spread of SARS , ah	4|35

++++++78++++++
Uh-huh .++++++79++++++
They said that e-government was very good but was not put into use .that e-government was very good but was not put into use	2|13
++++++80++++++
Well , this time I think that a short SMS like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through this e-government form .interaction between the government and the public	15|22

++++++81++++++
Uh-huh .++++++82++++++
Yes .++++++83++++++
We drive often in Beijing , ha , Yang Yang .++++++84++++++
If people were not informed of such a traffic accident through SMS on that day and they continued to head there , what do you think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ?of such a traffic accident	5|10
through SMS on that day	10|15
would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear	26|43
if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear	28|43
++++++85++++++
Yes .++++++86++++++
Ah , well , I think it would have been real paralysis .++++++87++++++
This is the most appropriate word to use .the most appropriate word to use	2|8

++++++88++++++
Furthermore , I think that when SMS was used to announce the news , it should be said to have fit the conditions in our China very well .that when SMS was used to announce the news , it should be said to have fit the conditions in our China very well	4|28
when SMS was used to announce the news	5|13
to have fit the conditions in our China very well	18|28
++++++89++++++
Why is that so ?++++++90++++++
This is because , it should be said that China is the country with the highest SMS usage .because , it should be said that China is the country with the highest SMS usage	2|18
the country with the highest SMS usage	11|18
++++++91++++++
There are probably not as many chances to use SMS in foreign countries compared with domestically , in China , ah .++++++92++++++
So , it can be said that penetration was quite high this time , by using the most familiar method , most used by everyone , as well as the most prompt and most convenient method , for the announcement .++++++93++++++
Yes , I noticed that many friends , around me received it .many friends , around me	5|10
++++++94++++++
It seems that almost everyone received this SMS .++++++95++++++
Yes .++++++96++++++
Yes .++++++97++++++
The effect was extremely good , ha .++++++98++++++
So , how exactly did citizens react ?++++++99++++++
Let 's take a look at the reactions of citizens .++++++100++++++
-- an SMS .++++++101++++++
I saw it was that Jingguang Bridge .++++++102++++++
Hey , I say , this is quite good , quite good .quite good , quite good	7|12
++++++103++++++
Have you received information like this before ?++++++104++++++
No , no .++++++105++++++
This was the first time .++++++106++++++
The first time ?++++++107++++++
Yes , yes .++++++108++++++
Well , what do you think of the speed at which the government responded this time ?the speed at which the government responded this time	7|16
++++++109++++++
Quite fast .++++++110++++++
Really quite fast , ah .++++++111++++++
So , I did not drive today .++++++112++++++
I set out a bit earlier and took the subway here .++++++113++++++
Do you think that the response of the government was fast this time ?that the response of the government was fast this time	3|13
++++++114++++++
Ah , the response was quite fast .++++++115++++++
In addition , various media announcements were also quite prompt .In addition	0|2
++++++116++++++
Colleagues and friends also informed one another by phone calls and SMS .phone calls and SMS	8|12
by phone calls and SMS	7|12
++++++117++++++
I think this plan was quite speedy .++++++118++++++
It seems that through this kind of SMS , citizens responded very well and the effect was excellent , ha .that through this kind of SMS , citizens responded very well and the effect was excellent , ha	2|20
through this kind of SMS	3|8
++++++119++++++
Well , apart from the , ah , point on information disclosure brought out by this accident , the fact is that the activation of emergency contingency plans by the , ah , government has also left people with a very deep impression .information disclosure brought out by this accident	10|17

++++++120++++++
Let 's find out the situation at that time through some footage .++++++121++++++
Well , we know that after the road cave - in accident , ah , ah , traffic police and emergency rescue personnel rushed to the scene , ah , to direct traffic and carry out emergency repair of sewage pipes .the road cave - in accident	6|12

++++++122++++++
Well , lots of barricade tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of the accident scene beneath the Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road .the north - south direction of the accident scene	15|24
++++++123++++++
All personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes , ah , have arrived at their designated locations .All personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes	0|11

Uh-huh .++++++126++++++
Okay , ah , , this emergency repair worker said that he was there at 4 o'clock .++++++127++++++
That means that they arrived at the scene right after the pre-dawn accident occurred .that they arrived at the scene right after the pre-dawn accident occurred	2|14

++++++128++++++
Well , it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news .that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news	6|19

++++++129++++++
Well , ah , Yang Yang , you work at Traffic Radio Station , ha , well , and we know that you all gave an extensive live broadcast this morning .Yang Yang	4|6
that you all gave an extensive live broadcast this morning	21|31
++++++130++++++
A special program .++++++131++++++
Yes , a special program on this traffic .++++++132++++++
So , let 's first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident .the impact on traffic after the accident	9|16
to the impact on traffic after the accident	8|16
++++++133++++++
Judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are the effects ?the traffic control measures taken after the accident	2|10
the eventual impact caused	14|18
++++++134++++++
Actually , concerning this , I think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in Beijing .concerning this	2|4
both of you are very familiar with the traffic in Beijing	7|18
very familiar with the traffic in Beijing	11|18
++++++135++++++
Previously we had a statistic , especially for the ring roads in Beijing .++++++136++++++
That is , if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as the Jingguang Bridge of the Third Ring Road , it might cause the entire Third Ring Road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jams during these morning and evening peak periods .an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident	6|13
bumper - to - bumper traffic jams	37|44
these morning and evening peak periods	45|51
if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as the Jingguang Bridge of the Third Ring Road	3|26
++++++137++++++
Uh-huh .++++++138++++++
It might even impact traffic on the Second Ring Road and Fourth Ring Road .traffic on the Second Ring Road and Fourth Ring Road	4|14
the Second Ring Road and Fourth Ring Road	6|14
++++++139++++++
Well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods .the time all traffic is cleared	16|22
until the time all traffic is cleared	15|22
to an hour during peak periods	30|36
++++++140++++++
Well , we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from Jingguang Bridge to Changhong Bridge from the south all the way to Guomao Bridge , blocking the main and side roads .the main and side roads	35|40
from Jingguang Bridge	18|21
++++++141++++++
Well , the situation would be unthinkable during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone .the first day of work for everyone	13|20
the first day of work for everyone	13|20
++++++142++++++
Hence , at that time , before 6:30 a .m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried .6:30 a .m .	7|11
before our live broadcast	13|17
before the live broadcast	25|29
++++++143++++++
However , actually after the entire day today , I came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in Beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam .the live broadcast here	23|27
an extremely high volume of traffic flow	37|44
the roads surrounding the section under traffic control	45|53
here right	11|13
with the live broadcast here	22|27
the section under traffic control	48|53
++++++144++++++
Uh-huh .++++++145++++++
However , the affected area was not as large as expected .++++++146++++++
Moreover , some people made detours once they received the news .once they received the news	6|11
++++++147++++++
Right .++++++148++++++
Psychologically , people felt quite relieved .++++++149++++++
Because I know this situation .++++++150++++++
Right , like those whom we interviewed just now .++++++151++++++
It was easy to handle once everyone understood .++++++152++++++
Yes , ah , , a citizen , he said , I set out today before the incident , and I did not drive after I was informed .after I was informed	24|28
++++++153++++++
That person did not even drive .++++++154++++++
Right .++++++155++++++
Actually , in this aspect , I think that citizens were really quite cooperative .in this aspect	2|5
++++++156++++++
For instance , this evening , we , received an SMS .For instance	0|2
++++++157++++++
A friend said , I work on the 12th floor of the China World Trade Center at the Guomao Bridge , ah .the 12th floor of the China World Trade Center at the Guomao Bridge	7|20
the China World Trade Center at the Guomao Bridge	11|20

++++++158++++++
We were discussing that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route .that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route	3|18
home	7|8
in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route	8|18
++++++159++++++
Later on , we suggested to him and said , you , ah , might as well take the subway , because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from the China World Trade Center .once you get down from the China World Trade Center	28|38
from the China World Trade Center	32|38
++++++160++++++
Right .++++++161++++++
Hey , he said this was quite a good idea .++++++162++++++
Actually , I think everyone was quite cooperative and also quite supportive in this aspect .++++++163++++++
Yes , many , viewers not in Beijing may not be quite familiar , ah , with this road section we just mentioned , where , ah , the accident occurred .viewers not in Beijing	4|8
this road section we just mentioned	17|23
quite familiar , ah , with this road section we just mentioned	11|23
++++++164++++++
Ah , we can take a look later through an animation .++++++165++++++
This road represents a main road on East Third Ring Road , with problems on both the main and side roads .both the main and side roads	15|21
++++++166++++++
Furthermore , Chaoyang Road is an intersection .++++++167++++++
Uh-huh .++++++168++++++
Whether it is Chaoyang Road in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road in the south - north direction , as we can see from this diagram , it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during commuting times .the main and side roads	12|17
the main and side roads	45|50
Whether it is Chaoyang Road in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road in the south - north direction , as we can see from this diagram	0|36
that the area at the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during commuting times	41|65
the area at the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road	42|55
++++++169++++++
Well , Chaoyang Road is a very important artery in the east - west direction .a very important artery in the east - west direction	5|15
a very important artery in the east - west direction	5|15
++++++170++++++
Yes .++++++171++++++
When people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road .people living in the west	1|6
in the west	3|6
over from the city	9|13
via this road	18|21
++++++172++++++
Hence , if a traffic accident occurs at this place , we can indeed imagine , ha , how widespread , ah , the extent of the impact will be , such as the number of cars caught in traffic jams .the number of cars caught in traffic jams	33|41
cars caught in traffic jams	36|41
at this place	7|10

Yes , actually I think everyone can see that from the buses that cross Jingguang Bridge .the buses that cross Jingguang Bridge	10|16

++++++174++++++

that 32 bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted	28|40
++++++176++++++
Uh-huh .++++++177++++++
Well , I think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes .that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes	4|23

If the accident did not happen , perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many --so many	18|20
If the accident did not happen	0|6
++++++179++++++
It is really like this , just look at the bus signs .++++++180++++++
Right .++++++181++++++
Have not seen so many buses .so many buses	3|6
++++++182++++++
Right .++++++183++++++
Its effect on people has been extremely extensive .++++++184++++++
Yes .++++++185++++++
Uh-huh .++++++186++++++
Well , what measures did the traffic control department eventually take to direct traffic ?++++++187++++++

++++++188++++++
Let 's hear what Director Meng said .++++++189++++++
Um , our traffic control department immediately activated the traffic emergency response plan .++++++190++++++
In the roads close to where the problem emerged , we first set up traffic diversion points for traffic control at the southern and northern ends .In the roads close to where the problem emerged	0|9

That is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency , well , it went from a traditionally unilateral administrative management method , well , a method in which information was quite delayed , to disclosure and transparency of information , and very fast as well .a traditionally unilateral administrative management method	19|25
That is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency	0|13

I think in fact , we can sum up many beneficial experiences from this case and actually extend them to other areas .in fact	2|4
++++++232++++++
Yes , this is when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic .when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic	4|15

++++++233++++++
Traffic was the first thing to be impacted when this , cave - in accident occurred .when this , cave - in accident occurred	8|16

However , this accident actually involved many underground pipes , such as sewage pipes , ah , or water , ah , and gas , ah , pipes , that affect the lives of citizens in many other aspects .the lives of citizens in many other aspects	31|39

Yang Yang , do you know how many pipes there are underground ?Yang Yang	0|2
++++++237++++++
Right now , there should be seven main types of pipes buried underground .pipes buried underground	10|13

Yes , therefore besides our attention to the traffic issue just now , people are also very concerned , ah , with the situation after the accident , with other aspects affecting citizens ' lives .++++++242++++++
Let 's take a look again at this footage of the situation of dealing with the current scene .the situation of dealing with the current scene	10|18

++++++246++++++
Well , ah , Professor Zhou , as this incident involved many departments after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ?++++++247++++++
Yes .++++++248++++++
This is also --++++++249++++++
It is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up .the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up	3|17

Yes , I think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries .this kind , er , of public	7|14

How many groups of people will be sent ?++++++252++++++

Yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society .because social management requires division of labor in society	4|13

It is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified .a labor division trend that involves many departments	3|11

++++++255++++++
Uh-huh .++++++256++++++
How can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ?departments in this kind of situation	6|12
++++++257++++++
Well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another .under normal circumstances	3|6
that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another	12|24
++++++258++++++
For instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate .too many law enforcement departments	5|10
too many administrative departments	14|18
For instance	0|2
too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments	5|18
++++++259++++++
However , this time , through the execution of emergency contingency plans by Beijing Municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of Beijing Municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role .that the response speed of the different departments of Beijing Municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role	24|48
the response speed of the different departments of Beijing Municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms ,	25|44
++++++260++++++
Hence , I think this was also a kind of , er , trial of interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms .trial of interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms	13|18

++++++261++++++
Uh-huh .++++++262++++++
It was a very successful , er , response .a very successful , er , response	2|9
++++++263++++++
I think many good things can be summed up from this .++++++264++++++
Yes .++++++265++++++
Yang Yang , based on your understanding , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people 's lives were damaged after the accident , based on your understanding of the situation , how was remedial work carried out ?on your understanding of the situation	27|33
++++++266++++++
For instance , it is very cold during winter in Beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently .one of the lowest points	19|24
For instance	0|2
to one of the lowest points	18|24
++++++267++++++
Er , heating pipes were indeed damaged .++++++268++++++
Well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of about 70,000 square meters of Beijing .an area of about 70,000 square meters of Beijing	11|20
about 70,000 square meters of Beijing	14|20
about 70,000 square meters	14|18

++++++269++++++
Well , , in this regard , the Chaoyang district government did a very good job .++++++270++++++
After it , er , received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent , electric heaters to residents in more than 200 households within this area .residents in more than 200 households within this area	20|29

After it , er , received this order from the municipal government	0|12
++++++271++++++
It should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday .++++++272++++++
Well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly .that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly	16|24
++++++273++++++
Hence , over here , I think the municipal government , ah , including sub-district offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households .effort to take good care of resident households	21|29
the municipal government , ah , including sub-district offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households	7|29

I think it was done in a very humanitarian manner .in a very humanitarian manner	5|10
++++++275++++++
Uh-huh .++++++276++++++
Uh-huh .++++++277++++++
Professor Zhou , actually for such a large scale city as Beijing that has more than 14 million people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common .such a large scale city as Beijing	5|12
a suddenly occurring public emergency like this	28|35
++++++278++++++
Yes .++++++279++++++
I think it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations .it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations	2|13
++++++280++++++
For instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents .other , er , domestic and overseas cities	6|14
For instance	0|2
that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents	5|18
other , er , domestic and overseas cities	6|14
++++++281++++++
Perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before .++++++282++++++
This is because a city is a gathering place for modern life .because a city is a gathering place for modern life	2|12
a gathering place for modern life	6|12
++++++283++++++
It is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict .++++++284++++++
Hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur .++++++285++++++
The critical thing is --++++++286++++++
But the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents , and for a city , this is a test of its response capabilities .how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents	5|16
after the occurrence of such accidents	10|16
a test of its response capabilities	24|30
++++++287++++++
Yes .++++++288++++++
Yes .++++++289++++++
Yes , I think through a few incidents that happened in Beijing Municipality over recent years , such as SARS , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave - in at East Third Ring Road this time , I think it can be seen that Beijing Municipality 's response capabilities continued to improve each time .the snowfall a few years ago	21|27
the heavy rains two years ago	28|34
the road cave - in at East Third Ring Road	36|46
in Beijing Municipality	10|13
it can be seen that Beijing Municipality 's response capabilities continued to improve each time	51|66
++++++290++++++

It can be said that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone .this time , what was done	5|11
that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone	4|17

++++++292++++++
Um , well , I think , Yang Yang , perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect , ah .++++++293++++++
Yes .++++++294++++++
Because you often have this kind of direct SMS exchange with listeners .this kind of direct SMS exchange with listeners	4|12
++++++295++++++
It is because , we , Beijing Traffic Radio Station , has become a part of emergency planning in Beijing .because , we , Beijing Traffic Radio Station , has become a part of emergency planning in Beijing	2|20
++++++296++++++
Well , Beijing Traffic Radio Station is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade three and above .++++++297++++++
Well , for instance , as people still vividly remember , at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by Professor Zhou that people still vividly remember , there were no plans .++++++298++++++
Beijing Municipality still had no emergency plan .++++++299++++++
Well , at that time , it happened that I was hosting the Unblocked All the Way program in the studio that evening .the Unblocked All the Way program in the studio	12|21
++++++300++++++
Well , at that time , traffic was not at all unblocked .++++++301++++++
Ah , at that time there was none of this kind of interaction .none of this kind of interaction	7|13
++++++302++++++
It was not clear , it was very congested .++++++303++++++
You sat inside the studio and only knew about the heavy snowfall .++++++304++++++
You could find out other news only by telephone .++++++305++++++
The various methods and channels were extremely unclear .++++++306++++++
Well , later , when we experienced that rainfall in Beijing , that rainfall two years ago , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner .that rainfall two years ago	12|17
sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms	24|33
when we experienced that rainfall in Beijing	4|11
that rainfall two years ago , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms	12|33

++++++307++++++
From our perspective as media , I think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency today , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications , and instructions .the most effective announcements and notifications	38|44
From our perspective as media	0|5
it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency today , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications , and instructions	8|47
++++++308++++++
Yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city .++++++309++++++
Yes .++++++310++++++
It should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies .the process of resolving emergencies	7|12
++++++311++++++
Ah , apart from this , Professor Zhou , what do you think are the areas for improvement for a city , especially a booming city , when handling this kind of public emergency ?a city , especially a booming city	19|26
++++++312++++++
Right , I think this gave us many revelations , ah .++++++313++++++
First , I think one that should be especially important is early warnings and forecasts .one that should be especially important is early warnings and forecasts	4|15
++++++314++++++
This is because currently , there are , ah , frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities , ah .frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities	10|18

Uh-huh .++++++320++++++
That is , this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism must be set up .this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism	3|12

That is	0|2

In this way , you can manage and resolve an abnormal situation by turning it into a normal situation , without evolving into a sudden public emergency .In this way	0|3

by turning it into a normal situation	12|19
into a sudden public emergency	22|27
++++++323++++++
Uh-huh .++++++324++++++
Another thing I want to say is that besides , ah , emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms , I think some corresponding improvements should be made to the release of information , incident investigation , ah , and the relevant post-incident , responsibility system .to the release of information	27|32
emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms	12|18

In fact , , that is , we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect .that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect	10|24
++++++326++++++
For instance , we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility .an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility	5|14

++++++330++++++
Since we are entering new circumstances of human living , circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urbanized life , well , I think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning , early warning and forecast , emergency response , accident investigation , and accountability .scientific planning , early warning and forecast	42|49
Since we are entering new circumstances of human living	0|9

Their level of development is more advanced than ours .++++++334++++++
Although the scale of our urbanization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year , I think , with our economic development being relatively backward , we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries .at a rate of 1 % per year	9|17

I do n't think the Times had any choice though Howie .

That 's disparaging /.++++++735++++++
Secondly it is absolutely a misrepresentation that they told us before just the week before /.before just the week before	10|15

When Mister Carson the representative spoke to Mister Wallace Mister Wallace agreed that they had never verified what Mister uh Freeh had said /.to Mister Wallace Mister Wallace	6|11

and in fact it was n't until that Friday that we learned the substance of Mister Freeh 's charges /.the substance of Mister Freeh 's charges	12|19
++++++739++++++
So Sixty Minutes I think has just said something that is false /.something that is false	8|12
Sixty Minutes	1|3

When somebody named Howard Kurtz wrote a story in the Washington Post on Friday morning is the first time that the Clinton forces learned about that false and demonstrably false charge that good reporting by calling people who were at the meeting could have done would have verified that Mister Freeh made a false charge /.good reporting by calling people who were at the meeting	32|42

That 's false /.++++++748++++++
Are you saying that 's false /?++++++749++++++
They were never told /. /.++++++750++++++
or at least I 'm now basing this on what Mister Carson has told me /.++++++751++++++
Jay Carson is the spokesman for former president Bill Clinton /.the spokesman for former president Bill Clinton	3|10

++++++752++++++
Jay Carson is the spokesperson for President Clinton was not informed about the specific charge about the Khobar Towers which happens to be not true /.to be not true	21|25
++++++753++++++
President Clinton at that uh meeting did press the uh Crown Prince to cooperate with the FBI /.at that uh meeting	2|6
++++++754++++++
so what Mister Freeh said was false /.++++++755++++++
That was not understood by the Clinton people until it was read in the Washington Post in the story that you wrote because Sixty Minutes put a press release out /.in the Washington Post	12|16
++++++756++++++
Uh now look Lanny Davis Sixty Minutes gave Bill Clinton one hour last year to push his own ten million dollar autobiography /.his own ten million dollar autobiography	16|22

++++++763++++++
Look /.++++++764++++++
Look this is a program about good journalism /.a program about good journalism	3|8
++++++765++++++
Let 's ask a Sixty Minutes uh journalist to say do you have an obligation to verify a charge made by the former FBI director as whether it 's true or not /.++++++766++++++
Is it good enough to air it just because he says it /.++++++767++++++
or should you do reporting /?++++++768++++++
Good reporters would hear that charge and say that is an extremely serious charge to be levelled against former president Clinton /.that is an extremely serious charge to be levelled against former president Clinton	8|21

What that tells you is that there 's no controlling moral authority today in the Sunni Muslim world /.that there 's no controlling moral authority today in the Sunni Muslim world	5|18

Well what is the bigger story /?++++++823++++++

I think it should have been a big story /.++++++825++++++
Why was n't /-++++++826++++++
Is it because of Iraq fatigue /?++++++827++++++

++++++842++++++
that really crosses the line /.++++++843++++++
and we have to call them on it even if they do n't /.++++++844++++++
You 're recently back from Iraq /.++++++845++++++
and you write about driving in from Kuwait /.from Kuwait	6|8
++++++846++++++
You were guarded by the US navy /.++++++847++++++
and yet it was kind of a harrowing experience /.kind of a harrowing experience	4|9

This is the safe part /.++++++851++++++
Right exactly /.++++++852++++++
I was in the safe district /.++++++853++++++
I was guarded uh by the British Royal Marines actually because unfortunately they 've had now um uh roadside bombs down there not suicide bombs /.++++++854++++++

++++++855++++++
And it 's been I 've always felt the Achille 's heel /.++++++856++++++
You know my criticism of the Bush administration as you know we 've talked about this before is not that this war is not important /.++++++857++++++
I believe it is important much more important than I think the left has ever fully recognized /.it is important much more important than I think the left has ever fully recognized	2|17

their rifles were out /.++++++861++++++

Um how does that affect your perception as a journalist /?++++++863++++++
You 're there /.++++++864++++++
you 're being protected /.++++++865++++++
and you must have been a little bit nervous of what the safety situation is in there /.++++++866++++++

++++++868++++++
You could cross lines /.++++++869++++++
Journalists worked for the most part until the very end with Terry Anderson the kidnappings targets /.++++++870++++++
Therefore by the end of the Lebanon story I thought the best journalists there knew more than the Lebanese /.the best journalists there	10|14

++++++871++++++
I always thought the best compliment you could get as a journalist is when you told the Lebanese something they did n't know because you were moving around so much /.when you told the Lebanese something they did n't know because you were moving around so much	13|30

++++++872++++++
What 's so frustrating about the Iraq story Howie no one has a bird 's eye view /.++++++873++++++
I care passionately about this story /.++++++874++++++
I 'm so interested in it /.++++++875++++++

And therefore it 's limited /.++++++878++++++
and in fact as you know the administration says because of the security situation and maybe because of some biases in the media /.in fact	1|3

Do you think that is a credible argument at this point in the mess there /?this point in the mess there	9|15

No because I do n't have a bird 's eye view /.a bird 's eye view	6|11

I wish I could say /.++++++884++++++
I wish I could be so sure /.++++++885++++++

And as a reporter as a columnist who really cares about this story I find that really frustra- /-as a reporter as a columnist who really cares about this story	1|13
++++++891++++++
I can not report it the way I 'd love to /.++++++892++++++
So I 've been there five times /.++++++893++++++
but it 's episodic /.++++++894++++++
It 's here /.++++++895++++++
It 's there /.++++++896++++++
It 's never really putting your arms around the story /.++++++897++++++
pulling back the camera a bit in recent months you 'd have to say that the Iraq story has been overshadowed by Katrina by Rita by Tom DeLay by Harriet Miers by Valerie Plame and now by this Pakistan earthquake /.that the Iraq story has been overshadowed by Katrina by Rita by Tom DeLay by Harriet Miers by Valerie Plame and now by this Pakistan earthquake	14|40
++++++898++++++
Um inevitable with a war that drags on and on /.++++++899++++++
and these are all also important stories obviously /.++++++900++++++
but uh do you feel it 's getting the attention that it should /?the attention that it should	8|13
++++++901++++++
Yeah /.++++++902++++++
No because to me this is the whole ballgame of the Bush administration /.the whole ballgame of the Bush administration	6|13
++++++903++++++
Katrina and Rita they 'll come and go /.Katrina and Rita	0|3
++++++904++++++
but at the end of the day the Bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to Iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there /.a decent forward looking government	25|30
at the end of the day	1|7
to Iraq	20|22
++++++905++++++
If that happens then I think President Bush is going to have a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there /.a very huge quiver you know	12|18

President Bush is going to have a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there	6|23

Um if it does n't happen I think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure /.if it does n't happen	1|6
as a complete and utter failure	14|20
++++++907++++++
so everything rides on this not just for the administration though but for the American people /.on this not just for the administration though but for the American people	3|16
++++++908++++++
These are huge stakes involved /.huge stakes involved	2|5
++++++909++++++
And so I do n't think it 's gotten the attention it 's deserved /.the attention it 's deserved	9|14
++++++910++++++
And going back again to one of your Iraq collumns uh you observed the Iraqi military there which after all is supposed to be increasingly shouldering the burden of this conflict /.one of your Iraq collumns	5|10

Right I do n't think enough because there 's been a lot of happy talk around this Howie basically /.enough because there 's been a lot of happy talk around this Howie basically	5|19

Here 's what you learn when you go to Iraq /.what you learn when you go to Iraq	2|10

And where you do n't have that commander you do n't have a unit /.where you do n't have that commander	1|8
++++++924++++++
So the numbers the macro numbers do n't mean anything /.++++++925++++++
So I went down to see the navy there /.to see the navy there	4|9
++++++926++++++
The navy of Iraq has a terrific commander /.++++++927++++++
so the people around him they 'll follow him into battle /.the people around him	1|5

According to your estimation , how many left - behind children are there in China now ?there in China	12|15
++++++1730++++++
This group should be the biggest in number .++++++1731++++++

Let 's think about it this way .++++++1735++++++

According to the study by the task force , at present , the four main types of custody for left - behind children include single - parent custody , skip - generation custody , relative custody , and same - generation custody .

Since their parents are absent , how can these children communicate and exchange with their parents ?++++++1887++++++
Our study found that um , um , the principal means of contact between the left - behind children and their parents was through the telephone .the left - behind children and their parents	14|22
++++++1888++++++
However , contrary to our belief that they could talk on the phone for a long time when they called , approximately 50 percent of the left - behind children we surveyed talked on the phone with their parents for three minutes or so .a long time when they called	14|20

The parents may not have realized this point , so they hang up the phone immediately .++++++1903++++++
Of course , for three minutes , why was it only for three minutes ?++++++1904++++++
In many cases , it was because they worried about the charge .++++++1905++++++
, many left - behind children told us that they especially wanted to call their parents on the phone .that they especially wanted to call their parents on the phone	8|19

We interviewed some left - behind children , their custodians , and the people who work in the city .the people who work in the city	12|19

++++++1917++++++
Why would n't the children know what they did ?++++++1918++++++
First , we can tell from the content of the three - minute telephone conversations we mentioned earlier that children are particularly concerned about the safety of the parents who work in the city .the three - minute telephone conversations	9|15

Why do you want to know about that ?++++++1940++++++
It is because I care about my parents very much .because I care about my parents very much	2|10

Then , are these children willing to live with their parents ? Or go to the city with them ?with their parents	8|11

++++++1947++++++
In regard to this , first , , children all want their parents to come back to live with them .In regard to this	0|4
++++++1948++++++
However , 51 percent of the children we surveyed were unwilling to go to the city with their parents , go to the city , to live in the city .unwilling to go to the city with their parents , go to the city	10|24

This was also very surprising to us .++++++1952++++++

I believe when parents make this decision , their main consideration is not willing or unwilling .when parents make this decision , their main consideration is not willing or unwilling	2|16

++++++1962++++++
However , with the reality that they have to face , I believe that they can not solve this problem .++++++1963++++++
Of course , we know what the reality is .Of course	0|2
++++++1964++++++
First , their families are rather poor to begin with .rather poor to begin with	5|10

They will need a huge sum of money in order to bring their children to the city .order to bring their children to the city	9|17

++++++1968++++++
Nonetheless , I believe there are also many other reasons .++++++1969++++++
They also have to consider whether their children can go to school in the city .whether their children can go to school in the city	5|15
to school in the city	10|15

If the children go to the city , the expenses will be very high .to the city	4|7

Since circumstances do not permit , they can not bring their children with them , according to their will or their psychological need .their will or their psychological need	17|23

++++++1979++++++
It is hard to tell from the surface .from the surface	5|8

Why is it so ?++++++1981++++++
For these children , it depends on how long their parents have been working in the city .For these children	0|3

In this case , um , generally speaking , uh , we did not conduct any psychological testing or comparison in this psychological aspect .In this case	0|3
++++++1984++++++
However , many schools and custodians reported that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn .that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn	7|17

They had very strange um , um , temperaments .++++++1986++++++

After that , he became extremely , extremely , annoyed .++++++1992++++++

++++++1995++++++
Um , of course , it was not necessarily because his parents worked in the city .in the city	13|16
++++++1996++++++
However , for some left - behind children , their parents working in the city has caused some psychological abnormalities and unusual development .some psychological abnormalities and unusual development	17|23

for some left - behind children , their parents working in the city	2|15

This situation indeed exists .++++++1998++++++
After all , these are families whose love is inadequate and incomplete .After all	0|2

I believe love is especially important .++++++2000++++++

Therefore , for this type , um , um , um , this group of left - behind children , psychologically , they do not have family love .this group of left - behind children	12|19

Good .++++++6271++++++
%um , like every++++++6272++++++
now is he with a publishing house now ?a publishing house now	4|8
++++++6273++++++
Which one is he with .++++++6274++++++
Yes which one %um++++++6275++++++
Well I can++++++6276++++++
yeah++++++6277++++++
It 's one of these sort of universi- the public university book stuff .one of these sort of universi- the public university book stuff	2|13
++++++6278++++++
It might be Hard Core Brace .++++++6279++++++
I 'm not sure .++++++6280++++++
oh yeah .++++++6281++++++
I have two friends in publishing .++++++6282++++++
It may be the other one that just took the job with Hard Core Bracethe other one that just took the job with Hard Core Brace	3|15
++++++6283++++++
I do n't remember which one .++++++6284++++++
yeah .++++++6285++++++
Anyway , he 's enjoying it and liking it++++++6286++++++
and they 're doing okay .++++++6287++++++
yeah++++++6288++++++
he seems to feel really like he 's doing the right thingto feel really like he 's doing the right thing	2|12
++++++6289++++++
and he is Great still in academic publishing .++++++6290++++++
My other friend just moved to trade publishing after years in academic publishingafter years in academic publishing	8|13
++++++6291++++++
and mhm %um you know . It feels like maybe she made a compromisemhm %um	1|3
like maybe she made a compromise	8|14
++++++6292++++++
but it 's like three times the money as with everything elselike three times the money as with everything else	3|12
++++++6293++++++
so++++++6294++++++
wow wow++++++6295++++++
industry and academics %um++++++6296++++++
Terrible++++++6297++++++
yeah it 's amazing++++++6298++++++
and %um You know ages ago I got a card from Liz Gana .++++++6299++++++
I told you this .++++++6300++++++
because %uh you showed us her picture .++++++6301++++++
yeah++++++6302++++++
yeah++++++6303++++++
Crazy++++++6304++++++
%um and I keep thinking maybe I 'd get in touch++++++6305++++++
but I have n't done it .++++++6306++++++
and then I saw in the %um Tufts thing that Ginny Totta you know in the alumni thing is living in thein the %um Tufts thing that Ginny Totta you know in the alumni thing is living in the	4|22
++++++6307++++++
yeah++++++6308++++++
So , anyway , how are you doing these days ?++++++6309++++++
Things are going very well .++++++6310++++++
I think I had mentioned before %uh , that there 's a company now that I 'm working with %um , %uh , which is very much just myself and Guss .myself and Guss	28|31
I had mentioned before %uh , that there 's a company now that I 'm working with %um , %uh , which is very much just myself and Guss	2|31
with %um	18|20
very much just myself and Guss	25|31
++++++6311++++++
oh .++++++6312++++++
And that %um++++++6313++++++
No , you had n't mentioned that .++++++6314++++++
%eh , oh , okay .++++++6315++++++
okay , so %um++++++6316++++++
%eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at ,that you were leaving the company that you were at	4|14
++++++6317++++++
and you were entertaining offers .++++++6318++++++
And , %uh++++++6319++++++
well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to just kind of set up my own company , of sorts .to make sense since I had a client to just kind of set up my own company , of sorts	3|23
++++++6320++++++
%um oh . So things are going extremely well .++++++6321++++++
So , I had one client who said that he 'd pay me a minimum amount .one client who said that he 'd pay me a minimum amount	4|16
++++++6322++++++
You know , he , %uh ,++++++6323++++++
there would be a minimum amount of work , of about %uh , a day a week for the next two three years . mhm . Which is sufficient to pay all my bills thenthe next two three years	18|23
a minimum amount of work , of about %uh , a day a week for the next two three years . mhm . Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then	3|35
sufficient to pay all my bills then	28|35
++++++6324++++++
so I decided that it would make sense to do this .++++++6325++++++
%um and , %um , I 've been getting substantially more work than then .substantially more work	9|12
++++++6326++++++
%mm .++++++6327++++++
So I 'm quite pleased .++++++6328++++++
Well that 's good .++++++6329++++++
%um , so I have a bunch of %uh work that I need to do on my flat this year .a bunch of %uh work that I need to do on my flat this year	5|20
++++++6330++++++
I 've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time .that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time	5|17
++++++6331++++++
But , %uh , it should come out this year .++++++6332++++++
oh , well that 's good .oh , well	0|3
++++++6333++++++
It should be done in a few months .in a few months	4|8
++++++6334++++++
oh , yeah++++++6335++++++
I remember So you talking a little bit about it at one point .++++++6336++++++
yeah ,++++++6337++++++
yeah .++++++6338++++++
So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon ?over this way	7|10
++++++6339++++++
%um . I do n't see the finances occurring uh-huh , right . for a while .the finances occurring uh-huh , right . for a while	6|16
uh-huh , right .	9|13
++++++6340++++++
%um , actually right at the moment finances are not going real well .++++++6341++++++
But %ah well . I am working on that one .%ah well .	1|4
++++++6342++++++
%uh .++++++6343++++++
It 's just But %um %uh , %uh , the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up %ah . %uh , related to a couple of burglaries that I had .++++++6344++++++
oh , harsh . Harsh .++++++6345++++++
yeah .++++++6346++++++
yeah ,++++++6347++++++
and .++++++6348++++++
Not a whole lot I can do about that now .Not a whole lot	0|4
++++++6349++++++
Indeed . Indeed .++++++6350++++++
have to deal with the situation .++++++6351++++++
And++++++6352++++++
So that 's what I 'm doing .++++++6353++++++
Sounds good .++++++6354++++++
But %um Anyway , %uh One of the main reasons that I 've been such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent has been work .such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent	14|21
such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent	14|21
++++++6355++++++
I 've actually been doing a lot of it .++++++6356++++++
oh wow .++++++6357++++++
And %uh , I turned in my Master 's thesis back in May ,in my Master 's thesis	5|10
++++++6358++++++
and I 'm actually presently working on , %um , several , %uh , articles oh , okay . Impressive . from it .%um , several , %uh , articles	8|15
++++++6359++++++
yeah ,++++++6360++++++
actually it turns out that one thing , one little bit in what I was doing , %uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end . %uh , from what I had been reading in the literature .that one thing , one little bit in what I was doing , %uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end . %uh , from what I had been reading in the literature	4|43
in the literature	40|43
++++++6361++++++
You see the one very annoying thing about all of this , was my advisor has been in France for a year and a half .the one very annoying thing	2|7
a year and a half	20|25
for a year and a half	19|25
++++++6362++++++
yeah .++++++6363++++++
And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there was n't much discussion .++++++6364++++++
yeah .++++++6365++++++
yup ,++++++6366++++++
yup .++++++6367++++++
But , %um Anyway , I had been kind of telling him that , you know , from my reading of the literature , I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique .from my reading of the literature	17|23
that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique	26|43
in my model	34|37
++++++6368++++++
mhm .++++++6369++++++
And it made the one type of solution occur , which was seen experimentally ,++++++6370++++++
but none of the other models %uh , had ?none of the other models	1|6
++++++6371++++++
Yes .++++++6372++++++
the- ,++++++6373++++++
I 'm looking at , %um , multi mode lasers .++++++6374++++++
And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased , %uh , states , where if you look at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser , you get an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency .if you look at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser	21|33
the things that they find experimentally	3|9
an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency	36|44
anti phased , %uh , states	13|19
++++++6375++++++
Yes .++++++6376++++++
okay .++++++6377++++++
if you separate out the different modes of the laser mhm . and look at one of those , you get more than one frequency .if you separate out the different modes of the laser mhm . and look at one of those	0|18
++++++6378++++++
okay .++++++6379++++++
So what 's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other 's Exactly . %hm . oscillations on these other frequencies .that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other 's Exactly . %hm	5|24
++++++6380++++++
And %uh With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient ,With a pretty simple model	2|7
in a transient	12|15
++++++6381++++++
but you ca n't find that frequency in a driven , %uh , frequency .in a driven , %uh , frequency	7|14
++++++6382++++++
You ca n't find so that it will sustain .++++++6383++++++
okay .++++++6384++++++
Yes .++++++6385++++++
So yeah , that particular frequency according to most models damps out very quickly .according to most models	6|10
++++++6386++++++
And so you should n't actually really be able to ever see it .able to ever see it	8|13
++++++6387++++++
%hm .++++++6388++++++
The only thing is , that , when you do the experiment you see it .when you do the experiment	7|12
++++++6389++++++
Got it ,++++++6390++++++
got it .++++++6391++++++
I see .++++++6392++++++
So , %um , I found a simple modification of the original formula , which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty . And in most cases , %uh , insoluble .++++++6393++++++
But yeah . it gives a driving term .++++++6394++++++
oh , okay .++++++6395++++++
So , it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer , you just ca n't always write it down very easily .a situation where you get the right sort of answer	5|15
++++++6396++++++
Exactly .++++++6397++++++
oh wow .++++++6398++++++
so you 're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser , %uh , whatever it is science .++++++6399++++++
But++++++6400++++++
which , %um , is kind of interesting considering that that 's not really my thing . . Indeed . Indeed . being an experimentalist , not a theorist .an experimentalist , not a theorist	23|29
kind of interesting considering that that 's not really my thing .	5|17
an experimentalist , not a theorist	23|29
++++++6401++++++
%um Indeed . oh wow . oh , impressive . But++++++6402++++++
so are you going to get an article in Nature or something ?an article in Nature or something	6|12
++++++6403++++++
%um , actually , I 'm not sure if we 're shooting for op- ,++++++6404++++++
I think Optics Letters is probably the one that we 're shooting for , or else , perhaps , though I do n't think it 's quite that significant , would be Phys Rev Letters .the one that we 're shooting for	6|13
Optics Letters is probably the one that we 're shooting for , or else , perhaps , though I do n't think it 's quite that significant , would be Phys Rev Letters	2|35
the one that we 're shooting for	6|13
++++++6405++++++
%hm .++++++6406++++++
But , %uh , we want to write a letter , and then a couple articles .++++++6407++++++
yeah .++++++6408++++++
%hm . impressive .++++++6409++++++
And I do n't know how much you know about scientific literature ,++++++6410++++++
but letters are much more prestigious than , articles .++++++6411++++++
oh , okay .++++++6412++++++
oh , I did n't realize that .++++++6413++++++
okay .++++++6414++++++
yeah ,++++++6415++++++
so that 's why it 's actually a big deal iswhy it 's actually a big deal	3|10
++++++6416++++++
I mean , you know , writing a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis , is , not at all unusual in Physicsarticles based on your Master 's thesis	10|17
a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis	7|17
on your Master 's thesis	12|17
++++++6417++++++
and yeah . %uh , it 's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all .the impressive part of it all	18|24
yeah . %uh ,	1|5
the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all	7|24
a letter that is the impressive part of it all	14|24
the impressive part of it all	18|24
++++++6418++++++
And what 's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant .kind of interesting	4|7
telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant	10|21
++++++6419++++++
And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that You know , people see the anti phased motion ,writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that You know , people see the anti phased motion	3|25
++++++6420++++++
and it 's true++++++6421++++++
they do in the transientsin the transients	2|5
++++++6422++++++
And I was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature has this frequency in the transients Yes . %eh and not driven .++++++6423++++++
And , %uh , what happened was after I had turned in my thesis but before I saw Neil again , he went to a conference in Rochester and there this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work , was , that their models could n't show this as a driven frequency ,the people who were doing this work	36|43
in my thesis	11|14
to a conference in Rochester	23|28
++++++6424++++++
yet their experiments showed it as a driven frequency .++++++6425++++++
oh cool .++++++6426++++++
and so Neil then -- Said oh just a second I -- like a week later came to Bryn MawrNeil then -- Said	2|6
to Bryn Mawr	17|20
++++++6427++++++
and he said , hey Lowell , we got to write this up .++++++6428++++++
Exactly .++++++6429++++++
And I was like , well I 've been telling you that Neil .++++++6430++++++
Indeed .++++++6431++++++
So Cool . Cool . that 's mostly the sort of stuff that I 'm spending a lot of time on now . %um++++++6432++++++
Well it 'll look good on your C V , your resume .++++++6433++++++
so you might as well spend the time .++++++6434++++++
Yes , well ,++++++6435++++++
%uh , no , it 's definitely worth doing . %um ,definitely worth doing . %um	6|11
++++++6436++++++
and I would have been spending more time on it if it were n't for %uh dealing with the burglary issues oh yeah but that I 've been dealing with .if it were n't for %uh dealing with the burglary issues oh yeah but that I 've been dealing with	10|30
++++++6437++++++
So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park .in that house	5|8
in the middle of the park	8|14
++++++6438++++++
Yes .++++++6439++++++
yeah , okay .++++++6440++++++
yeah .++++++6441++++++
I mean the thing that i-the thing that i-	2|6
++++++6442++++++
this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to .incredibly easy to break into if you want to	3|12
++++++6443++++++
oh .++++++6444++++++
It 's not a question of whether or not , %uh you know , that was easy ,++++++6445++++++
it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into .++++++6446++++++
Exactly .++++++6447++++++
Exactly .++++++6448++++++
yeah .++++++6449++++++
And so the problem is that now they found out that it 's worth breaking into .that now they found out that it 's worth breaking into	5|16
++++++6450++++++
yeah .++++++6451++++++
And unfortunately .++++++6452++++++
Well , it 's kind of odd .++++++6453++++++
They 've stolen very weird things for the most part .very weird things for the most part	3|10
very weird things	3|6
++++++6454++++++
%hm .++++++6455++++++
as far++++++6456++++++
yeah++++++6457++++++
as a .++++++6458++++++
The first time they broke in , what they stole was just bizarre ,The first time they broke in	0|6
++++++6459++++++
mostly worthless stuff .++++++6460++++++
And , %uh %huh the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the pre-amplifier of my stereo . Unfortunately , because it 's a nice pre-amplifier ,as far as monetary value	8|13
++++++6461++++++
it has an off board power supply which they did n't steal , which makes the thing that they **stoled** absolutely worthless .++++++6462++++++
%huh .++++++6463++++++
So .++++++6464++++++
That 's bizarre . Bizarre .++++++6465++++++
so when they broke in the second time did they steal the %uh offboard amplifier ?in the second time	4|8
when they broke in the second time	1|8
++++++6466++++++
Actually , no ,++++++6467++++++
all they stole the second time was my bike .all they stole the second time	0|6
++++++6468++++++
%huh .++++++6469++++++
Which was actually where the major problem came . Exactly . Exactly . yeah . Is that I suddenly had no transportation .++++++6470++++++
And so , I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike ,++++++6471++++++
and %mm . that cost me a lot of time .++++++6472++++++
yeah .++++++6473++++++
Exactly .++++++6474++++++
Because ,++++++6475++++++
yes++++++6476++++++
Spending a lot of time hunting for bikes , and nah well . then getting one purchased , and then having to , you know , go get it and things like that .it and things like that	28|33
++++++6477++++++
But , that 's dealt with at least .++++++6478++++++
And so %uh , that 's yeah at least dealt with .++++++6479++++++
Now I just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this .the financial aspects of all of this	7|14
++++++6480++++++
But yeah . yeah .++++++6481++++++
At least Well that would make sense during the summer %uh according to the stipulations of my fellowship , I can actually earn money during the summer .during the summer %uh according to the stipulations of my fellowship , I can actually earn money during the summer	7|27
++++++6482++++++
But %um , guessed what happened .++++++6483++++++
What ?++++++6484++++++
%um The %um++++++6485++++++
Again ?++++++6486++++++
%um 118.91_120.82_B: Let 's see ,++++++6487++++++
two weeks ago++++++6488++++++
I know Sue is going to Rhode Island .to Rhode Island	5|8
++++++6489++++++
%eh Right .++++++6490++++++
Right .++++++6491++++++
Did she see her mom ?++++++6492++++++
Yes she did .++++++6493++++++
And ?++++++6494++++++
Yes she did .++++++6495++++++
And ?++++++6496++++++
%um , %um , which we had already anticipated that it was going to happen .++++++6497++++++
I spoke to her mom on Thursday++++++6498++++++
%um and I asked her++++++6499++++++
I said listen++++++6500++++++
I said %um please come to Shabbatto Shabbat	5|7
++++++6501++++++
things have come to a point where I may have to relinquish my , %uh parenting .to a point where I may have to relinquish my , %uh parenting	3|16
++++++6502++++++
%uh would you mind %uh taking her back++++++6503++++++
and she said no .++++++6504++++++
She said %uh she 'd be more than happy to .++++++6505++++++
Really ?++++++6506++++++
This girl has everything in her dreams you know .++++++6507++++++
it is as my husband says %uh , %uh al kadir the destiny .as my husband says %uh , %uh al kadir the destiny	2|13
++++++6508++++++
Selema I 'm telling you ,++++++6509++++++
it is like Allah has just painted the roadlike Allah has just painted the road	2|9
++++++6510++++++
and all I had to do was get on it and follow it .++++++6511++++++
I mean things have been happening that has just scared the heck out of me .that has just scared the heck out of me	6|15
out of me	12|15
++++++6512++++++
I told mom++++++6513++++++
I said mom it is when you believe in Allah , when you have faith and know when you truly give your heart to Allah , only Allah can make the way clear for you .++++++6514++++++
%uh .++++++6515++++++
I believe that by her birthday she will be living with her mother .that by her birthday she will be living with her mother	2|13
with her mother	10|13
++++++6516++++++
Really ?++++++6517++++++
mhm mhm .++++++6518++++++
and is she seem like she 's together enough ?++++++6519++++++
she 's in a two year program .in a two year program	2|7
++++++6520++++++
She 's in the program now .++++++6521++++++
She 's doing very well .++++++6522++++++
When I talked to her I 'm talking to her like I 'm talking to you .When I talked to her	0|5
++++++6523++++++
I wrote her a letter and told her++++++6524++++++
I said I feel like I know you even though I never met you .I feel like I know you even though I never met you	2|14
like I know you even though I never met you	4|14
++++++6525++++++
They seemed surprised that ,surprised that	2|4
++++++6526++++++
I mean most women you lose your baby that 's it .++++++6527++++++
But almighty God is++++++6528++++++
You never even get a chance to see them again .a chance to see them again	4|10
++++++6529++++++
That 's true .++++++6530++++++
That 's true .++++++6531++++++
But that 's what she had wrote me .what she had wrote me	3|8
++++++6532++++++
she said it is just awesome to her what is happening .++++++6533++++++
yup .++++++6534++++++
mhm .++++++6535++++++
aw I 've heard of that .++++++6536++++++
yup .++++++6537++++++
So Francis++++++6538++++++
Did she say how she felt about what had happened ?++++++6539++++++
No .++++++6540++++++
we have n't really talked about that++++++6541++++++
but I 'm planning on making a trip down to visit her .++++++6542++++++
Well , how does Akina feel ?++++++6543++++++
she 's , very happy about it .++++++6544++++++
Very ha-++++++6545++++++
Well did she come home and say I saw her , I look like her or what ?her or what	14|17
home	4|5
I saw her , I look like her or what	7|17
++++++6546++++++
we talked on the phoneon the phone	2|5
++++++6547++++++
and you know she talked about %um her sisters you know and things++++++6548++++++
we 've spent the night with her sisters and thingswith her sisters and things	5|10
++++++6549++++++
and %um it 's just been quite interesting although when she was in Rhode Island she was very disruptive , %um down there and really caused Francis a lot of stress%um down there	20|23
although when she was in Rhode Island she was very disruptive , %um down there and really caused Francis a lot of stress	8|31
when she was in Rhode Island	9|15
++++++6550++++++
and %um Francis was very worried about me because she came home two weeks before you know %um because she just was acting like a total nigger child .home	11|12
++++++6551++++++
uh-oh !++++++6552++++++
Hope the research did n't hear that !++++++6553++++++
uh-oh !++++++6554++++++
wait++++++6555++++++
wait++++++6556++++++
Alita I 'm telling you nobody can handle her but you , okay .++++++6557++++++
And %um ,++++++6558++++++
but she was very concerned about me and everything %um because %um the child had told some lies about me and about you .some lies about me and about you	16|23
++++++6559++++++
oh .++++++6560++++++
oh 296.72_297.91_A: oh no .++++++6561++++++
And about++++++6562++++++
oh yeah mhm++++++6563++++++
oh goodness .++++++6564++++++
yeah .++++++6565++++++
That we were abusing ,++++++6566++++++
that %um you know ,++++++6567++++++
oh yeah++++++6568++++++
she did some %eh ,++++++6569++++++
and it was very , very bad .++++++6570++++++
My daughter - in - law Barbara got on her case real serious yesterday .My daughter - in - law	0|6

++++++6983++++++
I was like well that 's fine++++++6984++++++
but I would not feel comfortable going .++++++6985++++++
mhm .++++++6986++++++
I think that would be obnoxious++++++6987++++++
and I think they would then feel guilty for not inviting me .++++++6988++++++
Right .++++++6989++++++
To -- -- you know the other thing , the reception .++++++6990++++++
I just would n't go .++++++6991++++++
%mm .++++++6992++++++
So they had to take it down and drive her home .++++++6993++++++
%mm .++++++6994++++++
So they 're always kind of pissy at me .++++++6995++++++
%mm . That 's okay .++++++6996++++++
yeah .++++++6997++++++
yeah .++++++6998++++++
I mean I 've been thinking about it++++++6999++++++

mhm .++++++7002++++++
yeah .++++++7003++++++
Apparently they were also carrying lillies which is kind of goofy .++++++7004++++++

An- ,++++++7066++++++

I told him this morning to do it this week .this morning to do it this week	3|10
++++++7068++++++
uh-huh .++++++7069++++++
And he just keeps forgetting .++++++7070++++++
yeah .++++++7071++++++
But o-++++++7072++++++
How 's he doing ?++++++7073++++++
Much better .++++++7074++++++
yeah ?++++++7075++++++
yeah .++++++7076++++++
he 's often chipper .++++++7077++++++
He went for a walk this morning at five seventeen .five seventeen	8|10
at five seventeen	7|10
++++++7078++++++
Pe-++++++7079++++++
oh my god .++++++7080++++++
Is that because he 's not sleeping and++++++7081++++++
Well because he could n't breathe because all the cats were in the bedroom .because all the cats were in the bedroom	6|14
++++++7082++++++
oh .++++++7083++++++
So I think it 's time to give all the cats a bath .it 's time to give all the cats a bath	3|13
time to give all the cats a bath	5|13
++++++7084++++++
%mm .++++++7085++++++
yeah++++++7086++++++
and the- ,++++++7087++++++
you should do that .++++++7088++++++
I know .++++++7089++++++
It 's a two person job though .++++++7090++++++
I 'll have to get somebody to help me .somebody to help me	5|9
++++++7091++++++
%mm . yeah .++++++7092++++++
%hm .++++++7093++++++
But %uh , yeah ,++++++7094++++++
it 's still a fairly expensive call++++++7095++++++
%uh but it 's a lot less expensive if we do it that way than if we actually make my parents in law pay it ,++++++7096++++++
then it++++++7097++++++
the Dutch have such high taxes on those++++++7098++++++
they consider it a luxury to call around the worlda luxury to call around the world	3|10
a luxury to call around the world	3|10
around the world	7|10
++++++7099++++++
so they tax it really high .++++++7100++++++
Anyway %um++++++7101++++++
So you guys will be in either the eighteenth or the nineteentheither the eighteenth or the nineteenth	6|12
in either the eighteenth or the nineteenth	5|12
++++++7102++++++
and you 're going to go to %uh Amsterdam .to %uh Amsterdam	6|9
++++++7103++++++
Well I would say is once you 're at a hotel uh-huh %um , why do n't you call me at work and let me know where you are ,++++++7104++++++
and then we can make arrangements that day %um , that I can meet you in Amsterdam .++++++7105++++++
And maybe I 'll come by , public transport .by , public transport	5|9
++++++7106++++++
It 's probably easier for me to come by public transport in Amsterdam than it is for me to come by car to be honest .by public transport in Amsterdam	8|13
for me to come by car to be honest	16|25
to be honest	22|25
++++++7107++++++
mhm .++++++7108++++++
The streets are small++++++7109++++++
and there 's no parking .++++++7110++++++
So I probably will come by public transportby public transport	5|8
++++++7111++++++
but I do n't know .++++++7112++++++
We 'll see where you 're staying++++++7113++++++
%um++++++7114++++++
and there 's a lot more for you guys if you want to see stuffif you want to see stuff	9|15
++++++7115++++++
you can see stuff in Amsterdam++++++7116++++++
and %uh since the days are really long ,++++++7117++++++
I mean it stays light here till about ten thirty eleven o'clock mhm . at night .about ten thirty eleven o'clock	7|12
here till about ten thirty eleven o'clock mhm . at night	5|16
++++++7118++++++
So if you want we can take a ride and go see stuff at nightwe can take a ride and go see stuff at night	4|15
++++++7119++++++
and I can take you to some places ,++++++7120++++++
we can %uh go see some stuff .++++++7121++++++
%um , depends on what you guys want to see .++++++7122++++++
So you guys should pick out the things you want to see and let me know .++++++7123++++++
okay++++++7124++++++
%um and I 'll sit and talk with Anya about some things that maybe we think that it would be neat for you to see .++++++7125++++++
So if you do n't have any ideas we 'll just put something together for you .if you do n't have any ideas	1|8
++++++7126++++++
okay .++++++7127++++++
%um but yeah++++++7128++++++
but I can pick you up th- ,++++++7129++++++
you know I 'll probably be there some time around sixsome time around six	7|11
some time around six	7|11
++++++7130++++++
and we can like do a quick dinner or something yeah and go see whatever you want to see ,++++++7131++++++
if you want to stay in Amsterdam that 's fine .if you want to stay in Amsterdam	0|7
++++++7132++++++
If you want to go %uh off into the countryside somewhere and see a little bit of , echte Holland , real Holland and we can do that too .a little bit of	13|17
to go %uh off into the countryside somewhere and see a little bit of	3|17
into the countryside	7|10
++++++7133++++++
Actually I 've been up to Holland before .++++++7134++++++
Spent about two weeks up there .++++++7135++++++
yeah .++++++7136++++++
So %um ,++++++7137++++++
but that was years and years ago .++++++7138++++++
With your parents when your father was stationed over here , right ?++++++7139++++++
yeah .++++++7140++++++
But we got to see Den Haag and places like that too which we 're obviously not going to see this time .++++++7141++++++
But %um++++++7142++++++
has Kim been here before ?++++++7143++++++
And , an-++++++7144++++++
No .++++++7145++++++
oh good .++++++7146++++++
But then again I 'm not sure that Kim would be interested in seeing Shape Headquarters and you know all that kind of stuff . those military things .++++++7147++++++
Would you be interested in seeing Shape Headquarters again .++++++7148++++++
No . Not really .++++++7149++++++
yeah .++++++7150++++++
I did n't think so .++++++7151++++++
Somehow I had this feeling that the military taste had been beaten out of you .this feeling that the military taste had been beaten out of you	3|15
++++++7152++++++
yep .++++++7153++++++
I 'm ,++++++7154++++++
the mil- ,++++++7155++++++
I ca n't say too bad things about the military though .too bad things about the military	4|10
too bad things	4|7
++++++7156++++++
They still have my goods++++++7157++++++
and they 'll probably hold them hostage .++++++7158++++++
And they own my body and soul for like another four years++++++7159++++++
so I just got to pray that they++++++7160++++++
oh do they ?++++++7161++++++
yeah .++++++7162++++++
I owe four years in active reserve time .++++++7163++++++
aw great .++++++7164++++++
Do they do that to everyone ?++++++7165++++++
Milo , get out of there++++++7166++++++
yeah -- -- %eh everyone %uh who has n't been like you were++++++7167++++++
you went through like the thirty six two process .like the thirty six two process	3|9
through like the thirty six two process	2|9
++++++7168++++++
mhm .++++++7169++++++
So you do n't have it++++++7170++++++
but yeah if you just separate normally and you have n't served at least eight years , then you owe it .at least eight years	12|16
if you just separate normally and you have n't served at least eight years , then	2|18
++++++7171++++++
And that 's one of those things they just never tell you up front .one of those things they just never tell you up front	3|14
++++++7172++++++
No .++++++7173++++++
They never said anything++++++7174++++++
I figured there was something like that because++++++7175++++++
And I was in the inactive reserves the entire time I was in college too .++++++7176++++++
So .++++++7177++++++
yeah .++++++7178++++++
I mean that 's the military .++++++7179++++++
I have my discharge papers and everything++++++7180++++++
uh-huh .++++++7181++++++
and I 've said that yeah I will give a urine sample or a blood sample if they call me back for those , but they 're going to have to pay my trip back to the states . because there 's no bases in Holland and I 'm not going to pay out of my own expenses to go to Germany or something for them .a urine sample or a blood sample	9|16
my trip back to the states	32|38
to Germany	60|62
if they call me back for those	16|23
++++++7182++++++
If they want me they can pay ,If they want me	0|4
++++++7183++++++
bring me back active duty and pay me for the day if they 're going to drag me off somewhere .++++++7184++++++
But %uh , first they have to find me .++++++7185++++++
yeah , that 's the other++++++7186++++++
it was i- ,++++++7187++++++
if you 're in another country I mean and you 're not planning on coming back to the U S what are they going to do even if you do n't .if you 're in another country	0|6
back to the U S	15|20
++++++7188++++++
yeah .++++++7189++++++
Well I mean I 'm still American citizen++++++7190++++++
and I still would like to be welcome in my own country .in my own country	8|12
++++++7191++++++
Although g-++++++7192++++++
%uh I mean if they denied my citizenship and I became a citizen here I probably would n't be a horror either ,++++++7193++++++
but %uh yeah++++++7194++++++
right now I mean I do want to keep my American citizenship++++++7195++++++
so .++++++7196++++++
I kind of want to++++++7197++++++
Are you going to become a dual citizen ?++++++7198++++++
What 's that ?++++++7199++++++
Are you going to try and become a dual citizen ?++++++7200++++++
Have dual citizenship ?++++++7201++++++
You ca n't do that ,++++++7202++++++
%um , the only way to be a dual citizen is if you 're born in a foreign countrythe only way to be a dual citizen	2|10
the only way	2|5
if you 're born in a foreign country	11|19
in a foreign country	15|19
++++++7203++++++
like if I were born in Holland and then had American parents . Then I could be a dual citizen .like if I were born in Holland and then had American parents	0|12
++++++7204++++++
But you ca n't++++++7205++++++
If I would to ask to become a citizen in Holland I would automatically lose my American citizenship .If I would to ask to become a citizen in Holland	0|11
++++++7206++++++
As far as the Americans are concerned , yeah .++++++7207++++++
yeah .++++++7208++++++
The Dutch could care less .++++++7209++++++
The Dutch would say fine++++++7210++++++
want to be a dual citizen ,++++++7211++++++
that 's fine ,++++++7212++++++
but the Americans as soon as you ask for another citizenship that act of asking for it takes away your American citizenship .++++++7213++++++
I mean it 's kind of stupid .++++++7214++++++
yeah .++++++7215++++++
So I 'm an expatriot .++++++7216++++++
An American expatriot .++++++7217++++++
An American living abroad .++++++7218++++++
I still have to file a tax return .++++++7219++++++
Do you ?++++++7220++++++
yeah .++++++7221++++++
But my first seventy five thousand dollars worth of income is tax free .++++++7222++++++
Good grief .++++++7223++++++
As long as I do n't bring it back to the states .++++++7224++++++
Good grief .++++++7225++++++
I R S for you , %huh ?++++++7226++++++
yeah .++++++7227++++++
oh they want their share .++++++7228++++++
They want their piece of meat .++++++7229++++++
But all foreign taxes are deductible ,++++++7230++++++
and my taxes here are fifty percent of income .++++++7231++++++
So the taxes here are so much higher that , yeah I would never have to worry about it .++++++7232++++++
Unless you became C E O of the company then maybe like a thousand dollars would be taxable , right ?++++++7233++++++
yeah .++++++7234++++++
Somehow it raises a small amount .++++++7235++++++
the problem 's going to %uh be Anya 's American salary is taxable here and at fifty percent++++++7236++++++
so we 're going to owe some money to the Dutch government on her salary .++++++7237++++++
aw .++++++7238++++++
Some amount that has to be deducted a certain amount++++++7239++++++
and the amount we pay the American government is deductible ,the amount we pay the American government	1|8
++++++7240++++++
but we 'll still owe some taxes .++++++7241++++++
Th- ,++++++7242++++++
see I do n't know how it works .++++++7243++++++
we 're going to be in need of some sort of accountant do it cause I have no clue how that all works .that all	20|22
++++++7244++++++
They do n't have the Quicken Dutch version ?++++++7245++++++
yeah .++++++7246++++++
%ah , you know I would n't trust it because it 's so complicated with this international garbage or else the Turbo Tax with the Dutch modules . that I just would n't trust it .because it 's so complicated with this international garbage or else the Turbo Tax with the Dutch modules . that I just would n't trust it	9|35
++++++7247++++++
I do n't know , %eh .++++++7248++++++
yeah .++++++7249++++++
So complicated when you 're dealing with a Dutch tax form .++++++7250++++++
Anya had to read it++++++7251++++++
and Anya and her father did n't understand the damn thing .++++++7252++++++
How am I supposed to understand it ?++++++7253++++++
I 'm really looking forward to moving to Oregon and dealing with ,++++++7254++++++
Oregon you pay state tax++++++7255++++++
Washington you do n't .++++++7256++++++
I 'm looking forward to that cause %uh++++++7257++++++
yeah++++++7258++++++
but You 'll be a student++++++7259++++++
so you ,++++++7260++++++
I mean you 're++++++7261++++++
what is your income ?++++++7262++++++
oh , well++++++7263++++++
See I think y- , %um ,++++++7264++++++
it 'll probably be about five thousand dollars the portion of this year that I 'm in Oregon++++++7265++++++
and then next year it 'll be eleven thousand .eleven thousand	7|9
++++++7266++++++
yeah .++++++7267++++++
But I mean you 're below the poverty line at that level .++++++7268++++++
yeah .++++++7269++++++
So I mean any income that y-any income that y-	3|7
++++++7270++++++
Well++++++7271++++++
But then I 've already made say like fifteen thousand or whatever here in Washington++++++7272++++++
but++++++7273++++++
That should be non taxable out of state income .++++++7274++++++
It should++++++7275++++++
but you know it 's not going to be a fun tax return year .a fun tax return year	9|14
++++++7276++++++
I had that when I went into the military .into the military	6|9
++++++7277++++++
But then again .++++++7278++++++
I had Kans- ,++++++7279++++++
I had to file three taxes .++++++7280++++++
I had to file Georgia , Kansas yeah and then my federal .Georgia , Kansas	4|7
++++++7281++++++
So .++++++7282++++++
Well , %um actually I think this phone call 's just about to end cause it 's only half an hour ,this phone call 's just about to end cause it 's only half an hour	6|21
++++++7283++++++
but %um++++++7284++++++
So let 's see .++++++7285++++++
I 'll give you a call when we arrive in h- ,in h-	9|11
++++++7286++++++
or maybe I 'll just call you when we get in Holland just to let you know we 're there ,when we get in Holland just to let you know we 're there	7|20
++++++7287++++++
so if we get in the eighteenth or the nineteenth and then call you back %um when we get to a hotel or something like that .the eighteenth or the nineteenth	5|10
a hotel or something like that	20|26
if we get in the eighteenth or the nineteenth and then	1|12
to a hotel or something like that	19|26
++++++7288++++++
okay that 's a great idea .++++++7289++++++
as soon as you get into Holland and get yourself settled you can call meas soon as you get into Holland and get yourself settled	0|11
++++++7290++++++
and %uh if it 's at night , just call Anya 's parents++++++7291++++++
okay so++++++7292++++++
and remember that if you dial in Holland you need to add a zerothat if you dial in Holland you need to add a zero	2|14
if you dial in Holland	3|8
++++++7293++++++
so like right now okay it 's one eight one zero area code .one eight one zero area code	7|13
++++++7294++++++
If you dial in Holland , it 's zero one eight one zero . okay in HollandIf you dial in Holland	0|5
zero one eight one zero	8|13
++++++7295++++++
and then yeah you can just call up++++++7296++++++
if it 's during the work hours , fine , call me at work .during the work hours	3|7
if it 's during the work hours	0|7
++++++7297++++++
If not , call Anya 's parents if you do n't have a new phone number for me .++++++7298++++++
And if you do , I 'll send it by email okay if I get it before this weekendokay if I get it before this weekend	11|19

What we know about Saddam Hussein in recent years is that he had changed a lot .that he had changed a lot	10|16
++++++7499++++++
He had Islamic tendecies and acts which many Iraqis mentioned , saying that Saddam supported to a great extent the building of mosques centers for memorizing Koran , and charities , and the dancer 's punishment was death .that Saddam supported to a great extent the building of mosques centers for memorizing Koran	12|27

++++++7502++++++
I have followed Saddam Hussein , especially in recent years , and I noticed about him was that there was religion but there was injustice and coarseness .++++++7503++++++
And his punishment was unjust .++++++7504++++++
I mean , for example , the dancer would be killed after second offence .for example	3|5
++++++7505++++++
I did not expect anyone to kill the dancer unless good would come of it , but like the most idiots his aim was correct but the method was wrong .anyone to kill the dancer unless good would come of it	4|15

++++++7506++++++

++++++7509++++++
But he was not a scholar nor feared in God .++++++7510++++++
I myself heard from some people who were in Iraq about the things that Saddam Hussein used to do , and could not be reasonably done by anyone other than a good Moslem To the extent that many said of his actions that they were only to gain favor amongst the Sunnis and the religious .of his actions	39|42

++++++7511++++++
But we judge by the appearances and his end was in line with the appearance .by the appearances	3|6
++++++7512++++++
In his last days during the fall of Baghdad and his disappearance , an old woman or man said on TV on al - Jazeera channel that he was hiding in her house and had had his prayer mat with him and was always praying and reading the Koran .the fall of Baghdad and his disappearance	5|12

++++++7517++++++

The Rafida were shouting provocative words such as Muqtada and al - Sadr so that he would lose control and curse them , then they would have killed him .provocative words such as Muqtada and al - Sadr	4|13
++++++7519++++++
So they could show the clip in which there is cursing and insults from Saddam and cut the rest .the clip in which there is cursing and insults from Saddam	4|15
++++++7520++++++
However he remained steadfast in saying the creed and was killed whilst saying it .steadfast in saying the creed	3|8

I believe that this could n't have happened without God making him steadfast otherwise God would not have made him steadfast in it .that this could n't have happened without God making him steadfast otherwise God would not have made him steadfast in it	2|23

As one of the sheikhs says , many people when they were supposed to say the creed and were being dictated the creed by those present would murmur " Did love see drunkards ? "++++++7523++++++
Other people say , I have not said it while I was alive and you want me to say it when I am dying ... the truth is what is apparent .while I was alive	9|13

1. China 's income tax can not become a tool for keeping the poor perpetually poor ; it can not become a social tool that keeps on producing a penniless proletariat .++++++7630++++++
In China the primary function of the income tax is to increase the state 's financial revenues ; it is not to regulate the income gap .to increase the state 's financial revenues	10|17
