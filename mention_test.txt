%um . I do n't see the finances occurring uh-huh , right . for a while .I	2|3

%ah well .	1|4
working	6|7
++++++6342++++++
%uh .++++++6343++++++
It 's just But %um %uh , %uh , the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up %ah . %uh , related to a couple of burglaries that I had .It	0|1
's	1|2
that	13|14
is	14|15

Not a whole lot I can do about that now .Not a whole lot	0|4
I	4|5

Not a whole lot	0|4
can	5|6

have to deal with the situation .the situation	4|6

actually	3|4
working	5|6
++++++6359++++++
yeah ,++++++6360++++++
actually it turns out that one thing , one little bit in what I was doing , %uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end . %uh , from what I had been reading in the literature .it	1|2
one thing	5|7
one little bit	8|11

You see the one very annoying thing about all of this , was my advisor has been in France for a year and a half .You	0|1
the one very annoying thing	2|7
all	8|9
this	10|11
my advisor	13|15
France	18|19
a year and a half	20|25
a year	20|22
a half	23|25
see	1|2
the one very annoying thing about all of this	2|11
been	16|17
for a year and a half	19|25
++++++6362++++++
yeah .++++++6363++++++
And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there was n't much discussion .this	1|2
my thesis	4|6
you	9|10
there	11|12
much discussion	14|16
made	2|3
writing	3|4
know	10|11
++++++6364++++++
yeah .++++++6365++++++
yup ,++++++6366++++++
yup .++++++6367++++++
But , %um Anyway , I had been kind of telling him that , you know , from my reading of the literature , I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique .I	5|6
been	7|8
telling	10|11
him	11|12
know	15|16
from my reading of the literature	17|23
thought	25|26
that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique	26|43
made	33|34
in my model	34|37
I	5|6
kind	8|9
him	11|12
you	14|15
my reading	18|20
the literature	21|23
I	24|25
this one little alteration	27|31
I	31|32
my model	35|37
++++++6368++++++
mhm .++++++6369++++++
And it made the one type of solution occur , which was seen experimentally ,it	1|2
the one type	3|6
solution	7|8
made	2|3
which	10|11
seen	12|13
experimentally	13|14
++++++6370++++++
but none of the other models %uh , had ?none of the other models	1|6
none	1|2
the other models	3|6
had	8|9
++++++6371++++++
Yes .++++++6372++++++
the- ,++++++6373++++++
I 'm looking at , %um , multi mode lasers .I	0|1
multi mode lasers	7|10
looking	2|3
++++++6374++++++
And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased , %uh , states , where if you look at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser , you get an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency .that	5|6
find	7|8
experimentally	8|9
are	9|10
what	10|11
call	12|13
anti phased , %uh , states	13|19
phased	14|15
states	18|19
look	23|24
at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser	24|33
where	20|21
if you look at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser	21|33
get	35|36
which	38|39
characterized	40|41
one	1|2
the things that they find experimentally	3|9
the things	3|5
they	6|7
they	11|12
you	22|23
the total intensity	25|28
the laser	31|33
you	34|35
an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency	36|44
an oscillation	36|38
one frequency	42|44
++++++6375++++++
Yes .++++++6376++++++
okay .++++++6377++++++
if you separate out the different modes of the laser mhm . and look at one of those , you get more than one frequency .you	1|2
the different modes	4|7
the laser	8|10
one	15|16
those	17|18
you	19|20
separate	2|3
look	13|14
if you separate out the different modes of the laser mhm . and look at one of those	0|18
get	20|21
++++++6378++++++
okay .++++++6379++++++
So what 's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other 's Exactly . %hm . oscillations on these other frequencies .the modes	6|8
phase	12|13
they	15|16
each other	18|20
these other frequencies	27|30
what	1|2
happening	3|4
is	4|5
that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other 's Exactly . %hm	5|24
completely	16|17
mask	17|18
's	20|21
Exactly	21|22
++++++6380++++++
And %uh With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient ,a pretty simple model	3|7
you	7|8
that frequency	10|12
a transient	13|15
With a pretty simple model	2|7
can	8|9
find	9|10
in a transient	12|15
++++++6381++++++
but you ca n't find that frequency in a driven , %uh , frequency .you	1|2
that frequency	5|7
ca	2|3
find	4|5
in a driven , %uh , frequency	7|14
driven	9|10
,	10|11
frequency	13|14
++++++6382++++++
You ca n't find so that it will sustain .You	0|1
it	6|7
ca	1|2
find	3|4
will	7|8
sustain	8|9
++++++6383++++++
okay .++++++6384++++++
Yes .++++++6385++++++
So yeah , that particular frequency according to most models damps out very quickly .that particular frequency	3|6
most models	8|10
according to most models	6|10
damps	10|11
++++++6386++++++
And so you should n't actually really be able to ever see it .you	2|3
it	12|13
so	1|2
you	2|3
should	3|4
actually	5|6
really	6|7
be	7|8
able to ever see it	8|13
see	11|12
it	12|13
++++++6387++++++
%hm .%hm .	0|2
++++++6388++++++
The only thing is , that , when you do the experiment you see it .The only thing	0|3
you	8|9
the experiment	10|12
you	12|13
it	14|15
is	3|4
do	9|10
when you do the experiment	7|12
see	13|14
it	14|15
++++++6389++++++
Got it ,it	1|2
++++++6390++++++
got it .it	1|2
++++++6391++++++
I see .I	0|1
see	1|2
.	2|3
++++++6392++++++
So , %um , I found a simple modification of the original formula , which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty . And in most cases , %uh , insoluble .I	4|5
a simple modification	6|9
the original formula	10|13
the solutions	17|19
most cases	24|26
found	5|6
which	14|15
unfortunately	15|16
makes	16|17
++++++6393++++++
But yeah . it gives a driving term .it	3|4
a driving term	5|8
gives	4|5
driving	6|7
++++++6394++++++
oh , okay .++++++6395++++++
So , it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer , you just ca n't always write it down very easily .it	2|3
a situation	5|7
you	8|9
the right sort	10|13
answer	14|15
you	16|17
it	22|23
actually	3|4
creates	4|5
a situation where you get the right sort of answer	5|15
where	7|8
get	9|10
just	17|18
ca	18|19
write	21|22
it	22|23
++++++6396++++++
Exactly .++++++6397++++++
oh wow .++++++6398++++++
so you 're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser , %uh , whatever it is science .you	1|2
the bounds	5|7
theoretical laser	8|10
it	14|15

pushing	3|4
forward	4|5
whatever	13|14
it	14|15
is	15|16

But++++++6400++++++
which , %um , is kind of interesting considering that that 's not really my thing . . Indeed . Indeed . being an experimentalist , not a theorist .%um	2|3

%um	2|3
is	4|5

%um , actually , I 'm not sure if we 're shooting for op- ,%um	0|1
I	4|5
we	9|10
shooting	11|12
++++++6404++++++
I think Optics Letters is probably the one that we 're shooting for , or else , perhaps , though I do n't think it 's quite that significant , would be Phys Rev Letters .think	1|2
Optics Letters is probably the one that we 're shooting for , or else , perhaps , though I do n't think it 's quite that significant , would be Phys Rev Letters	2|35
is	4|5
probably	5|6

that	8|9
shooting	11|12
for	12|13
think	23|24
it	24|25
's	25|26
perhaps	17|18
would	30|31
be	31|32

Phys	32|33

++++++6405++++++
%hm .%hm .	0|2
++++++6406++++++
But , %uh , we want to write a letter , and then a couple articles .we	4|5
a letter	8|10
a couple articles	13|16
want	5|6
write	7|8
++++++6407++++++
yeah .++++++6408++++++
%hm . impressive .%hm .	0|2
++++++6409++++++
And I do n't know how much you know about scientific literature ,I	1|2
you	7|8
scientific literature	10|12
know	4|5
know	8|9
++++++6410++++++
but letters are much more prestigious than , articles .letters	1|2
articles	8|9
letters	1|2
are	2|3
articles	8|9
++++++6411++++++
oh , okay .++++++6412++++++
oh , I did n't realize that .I	2|3
that	6|7
realize	5|6
that	6|7
++++++6413++++++
okay .++++++6414++++++
yeah ,++++++6415++++++
so that 's why it 's actually a big deal isthat	1|2
it	4|5
a big deal	7|10
that	1|2
's	2|3
why it 's actually a big deal	3|10
why	3|4
it	4|5
's	5|6
actually	6|7
++++++6416++++++
I mean , you know , writing a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis , is , not at all unusual in Physicsmean	1|2
know	4|5
writing	6|7
a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis	7|17
articles	10|11
based	11|12
on your Master 's thesis	12|17
is	18|19

your Master 's	13|16
Physics	25|26
++++++6417++++++
and yeah . %uh , it 's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all .it	5|6
I	10|11
a letter	14|16
the impressive part of it all	18|24
the impressive part	18|21
it all	22|24
it	22|23
all	23|24
yeah . %uh ,	1|5
it	5|6
's	6|7
the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all	7|24
would	11|12
writing	13|14
a letter that is the impressive part of it all	14|24
that	16|17
is	17|18
the impressive part of it all	18|24
++++++6418++++++
And what 's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant .what	1|2
's	2|3
actually	3|4
is	7|8
kept	9|10
telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant	10|21
telling	10|11
Neil	11|12
that I thought that this was kind of significant	12|21
thought	14|15
kind of interesting	4|7
kind	4|5
I	8|9
Neil	11|12
I	13|14
this	16|17
++++++6419++++++
And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that You know , people see the anti phased motion ,kept	2|3
writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that You know , people see the anti phased motion	3|25
writing	3|4
back	4|5
know	17|18
see	20|21

Neil	1|2
I	6|7
this part	9|11
You	16|17
people	19|20
the anti phased motion	21|25
++++++6420++++++
and it 's trueit	1|2
it	1|2
's	2|3
true	3|4
++++++6421++++++
they do in the transientsthey	0|1
the transients	3|5
do	1|2
in the transients	2|5
++++++6422++++++
And I was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature has this frequency in the transients Yes . %eh and not driven .I	1|2
a lot	4|6
trouble	7|8
him	11|12
all	13|14
the literature	15|17
this frequency	18|20
the transients	21|23
having	3|4
getting	8|9
all of the literature	13|17
has	17|18
driven	28|29
++++++6423++++++
And , %uh , what happened was after I had turned in my thesis but before I saw Neil again , he went to a conference in Rochester and there this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work , was , that their models could n't show this as a driven frequency ,what	4|5
happened	5|6
I	8|9
turned	10|11
in my thesis	11|14
saw	17|18
Neil	18|19
again	19|20
went	22|23
to a conference in Rochester	23|28
who	38|39
doing	40|41
could	49|50
show	51|52
this	52|53

frequency	56|57
I	8|9
my thesis	12|14
I	16|17
Neil	18|19
he	21|22
a conference	24|26
Rochester	27|28
there	29|30
this	30|31
a big issue	32|35
the people who were doing this work	36|43
the people	36|38
this work	41|43
their models	47|49
this	52|53
a driven frequency	54|57
++++++6424++++++
yet their experiments showed it as a driven frequency .their experiments	1|3
it	4|5
a driven frequency	6|9
showed	3|4
it	4|5
driven	7|8
frequency	8|9
++++++6425++++++
oh cool .++++++6426++++++
and so Neil then -- Said oh just a second I -- like a week later came to Bryn MawrNeil then -- Said	2|6
Neil then	2|4
Said	5|6
just a second I	7|11
a week	13|15
Bryn Mawr	18|20
came	16|17
to Bryn Mawr	17|20
++++++6427++++++
and he said , hey Lowell , we got to write this up .he	1|2
Lowell	5|6
we	7|8
this	11|12
said	2|3
write	10|11
this	11|12
++++++6428++++++
Exactly .++++++6429++++++
And I was like , well I 've been telling you that Neil .I	1|2
I	6|7
you	10|11
Neil	12|13
telling	9|10
you	10|11
++++++6430++++++
Indeed .++++++6431++++++
So Cool . Cool . that 's mostly the sort of stuff that I 'm spending a lot of time on now . %umthat	5|6
the sort	8|10
stuff	11|12
I	13|14
a lot	16|18

%um	23|24
that	5|6
's	6|7
mostly	7|8
spending	15|16
++++++6432++++++
Well it 'll look good on your C V , your resume .it	1|2
your C V	6|9
your resume	10|12
'll	2|3
look	3|4
++++++6433++++++
so you might as well spend the time .you	1|2
the time	6|8
might	2|3
spend	5|6
++++++6434++++++
Yes , well ,++++++6435++++++
%uh , no , it 's definitely worth doing . %um ,it	4|5
it	4|5
's	5|6
definitely worth doing . %um	6|11
++++++6436++++++
and I would have been spending more time on it if it were n't for %uh dealing with the burglary issues oh yeah but that I 've been dealing with .I	1|2
more time	6|8
it	9|10
it	11|12
the burglary issues	18|21
I	25|26
would	2|3

you	11|12
It	0|1
's	1|2
know	12|13
++++++6445++++++
it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into .it	0|1
no one	4|6
it	8|9
really	6|7
knew	7|8
breaking	11|12
into	12|13
++++++6446++++++
Exactly .++++++6447++++++
Exactly .++++++6448++++++
yeah .++++++6449++++++
And so the problem is that now they found out that it 's worth breaking into .the problem	2|4
they	7|8
it	11|12
so	1|2
is	4|5
that now they found out that it 's worth breaking into	5|16
found	8|9
breaking	14|15
into	15|16
++++++6450++++++
yeah .++++++6451++++++
And unfortunately .++++++6452++++++
Well , it 's kind of odd .it	2|3
it	2|3
's	3|4
++++++6453++++++
They 've stolen very weird things for the most part .They	0|1
very weird things for the most part	3|10
very weird things	3|6
the most part	7|10
stolen	2|3
++++++6454++++++
%hm .%hm .	0|2
++++++6455++++++
as far++++++6456++++++
yeah++++++6457++++++
as a .a	1|2
++++++6458++++++
The first time they broke in , what they stole was just bizarre ,The first time they broke in	0|6
The first time	0|3
they	3|4
they	8|9
broke	4|5
what	7|8
stole	9|10
++++++6459++++++
mostly worthless stuff .worthless stuff	1|3
++++++6460++++++
And , %uh %huh the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the pre-amplifier of my stereo . Unfortunately , because it 's a nice pre-amplifier ,the most worthwhile thing	4|8
monetary value	11|13
they	15|16
the pre-amplifier	18|20
my stereo	21|23
it	27|28
a nice pre-amplifier	29|32
as far as monetary value	8|13
went	13|14
stole	16|17
it	27|28
's	28|29
++++++6461++++++
it has an off board power supply which they did n't steal , which makes the thing that they **stoled** absolutely worthless .it	0|1
they	8|9
the thing	15|17
they	18|19
has	1|2
which	7|8
steal	11|12
makes	14|15
++++++6462++++++
%huh .++++++6463++++++
So .++++++6464++++++
That 's bizarre . Bizarre .That	0|1
That	0|1
's	1|2
++++++6465++++++
so when they broke in the second time did they steal the %uh offboard amplifier ?they	2|3
the second time	5|8
they	9|10
the %uh offboard amplifier	11|15
broke	3|4
in the second time	4|8
when they broke in the second time	1|8
steal	10|11
++++++6466++++++
Actually , no ,++++++6467++++++
all they stole the second time was my bike .all they stole the second time	0|6
all	0|1
they	1|2
the second time	3|6
my bike	7|9
all	0|1
stole	2|3

I	17|18
no transportation	20|22
where	3|4
came	7|8
Is	15|16

++++++6471++++++
