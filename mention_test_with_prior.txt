++++++6356++++++
oh wow .

++++++6357++++++
And %uh , I turned in my Master 's thesis back in May ,
my	6|6
And	0|1
%uh	1|2
I	3|4
turned	4|5
in my Master 's thesis	5|10

++++++6358++++++
and I 'm actually presently working on , %um , several , %uh , articles oh , okay . Impressive . from it .
I	1|2
actually	3|4
presently	4|5
working	5|6
working on	5|7

++++++6359++++++
yeah ,

++++++6360++++++
actually it turns out that one thing , one little bit in what I was doing , %uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end . %uh , from what I had been reading in the literature .
actually	0|1
turns	2|3
that one thing , one little bit in what I was doing , %uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end . %uh , from what I had been reading in the literature	4|43

You see the one very annoying thing about all of this , was my advisor has been in France for a year and a half .
in	17|17

++++++6362++++++
yeah .

++++++6363++++++
And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there was n't much discussion .
And	0|1
this	1|2

++++++6364++++++
yeah .

++++++6365++++++
yup ,

++++++6366++++++
yup .
yup	0|0

++++++6367++++++
But , %um Anyway , I had been kind of telling him that , you know , from my reading of the literature , I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique .
I	5|6
been	7|8
had been kind of telling him that , you know	6|16
been kind of telling him that , you know	7|16
kind of telling him that , you know	8|16
of telling him that , you know	9|16
telling him that , you know	10|16

this one little alteration I had made in my model	27|37

was kind of clever and unique	37|43

++++++6368++++++
mhm .

++++++6369++++++
And it made the one type of solution occur , which was seen experimentally ,
And	0|1
it	1|2
made	2|3
occur , which was seen experimentally	8|14
which was seen experimentally	10|14
was seen experimentally	11|14
was seen experimentally	11|14

++++++6370++++++
but none of the other models %uh , had ?
but	0|1
had	8|9
but none of the other models %uh , had ?	0|10

++++++6371++++++
Yes .

++++++6372++++++
the- ,

++++++6373++++++
I 'm looking at , %um , multi mode lasers .
I	0|1
looking	2|3
at , %um , multi mode lasers	3|10
at , %um , multi mode lasers	3|10

++++++6374++++++
And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased , %uh , states , where if you look at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser , you get an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency .
the things	3|5
that	5|6
they	6|7
find	7|8
experimentally	8|9
the things that they find experimentally	3|9
that they find experimentally	5|9
find experimentally	7|9
anti phased , %uh , states	13|19
uh-huh .	28|30
get an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency	35|44
an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency	36|44
which is characterized by one frequency	38|44
is characterized by one frequency	39|44
characterized by one frequency	40|44

++++++6375++++++
Yes .

++++++6376++++++
okay .

++++++6377++++++
if you separate out the different modes of the laser mhm . and look at one of those , you get more than one frequency .
you	1|2
separate	2|3
the different modes of the laser	4|10
separate out the different modes of the laser	2|10
look at one of those	13|18
at one of those	14|18
get more than one frequency	20|25

++++++6378++++++
okay .

++++++6379++++++
So what 's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other 's Exactly . %hm . oscillations on these other frequencies .
what	1|2
happening	3|4
what 's happening	1|4
's happening	2|4
's happening	2|4
's Exactly	20|22
oscillations on these other frequencies	25|30

++++++6380++++++
And %uh With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient ,
And	0|1
%uh	1|2
With a pretty simple model	2|7
you	7|8
can	8|9
find	9|10
that frequency	10|12
in a transient	12|15
With a pretty simple model	2|7
can find that frequency in a transient	8|15
find that frequency in a transient	9|15

++++++6381++++++
but you ca n't find that frequency in a driven , %uh , frequency .
but	0|1
you	1|2
ca	2|3
n't	3|4
find	4|5
that frequency	5|7
in a driven , %uh , frequency	7|14
in a driven , %uh , frequency	7|14
a driven , %uh , frequency	8|14

++++++6382++++++
You ca n't find so that it will sustain .
You	0|1
ca	1|2
n't	2|3
find	3|4
so that it will sustain	4|9
You ca n't find so that it will sustain .	0|10
ca n't find so that it will sustain	1|9
find so that it will sustain	3|9
so that it will sustain	4|9
it will sustain	6|9
will sustain	7|9

++++++6383++++++
okay .

++++++6384++++++
Yes .

++++++6385++++++
So yeah , that particular frequency according to most models damps out very quickly .
So	0|1
according to most models	6|10
damps	10|11
very quickly	12|14
according to most models	6|10
damps out very quickly	10|14

++++++6386++++++
And so you should n't actually really be able to ever see it .
And	0|1
so	1|2
you	2|3
should	3|4
n't	4|5
actually	5|6
really	6|7
be	7|8
able to ever see it	8|13
be able to ever see it	7|13
able to ever see it	8|13
to ever see it	9|13
to ever see it	9|13

++++++6387++++++
%hm .

++++++6388++++++
The only thing is , that , when you do the experiment you see it .
The only thing	0|3
is	3|4
when you do the experiment you see it	7|15
when you do the experiment	7|12

++++++6389++++++
Got it ,
Got it ,	0|3

++++++6390++++++
got it .
got it .	0|3

++++++6391++++++
I see .
I	0|1
see	1|2
.	2|3

++++++6392++++++
So , %um , I found a simple modification of the original formula , which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty . And in most cases , %uh , insoluble .
So	0|1
%um	2|3
I	4|5
found	5|6
unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty .	15|22
makes the solutions horrendously nasty	16|21
the solutions horrendously nasty	17|21
And in most cases	22|26

++++++6393++++++
But yeah . it gives a driving term .
But	0|1
yeah	1|2
it	3|4
gives	4|5
a driving term	5|8
But yeah . it gives a driving term .	0|9

++++++6394++++++
oh , okay .
oh , okay .	0|4

++++++6395++++++
So , it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer , you just ca n't always write it down very easily .
it	2|3
actually	3|4
creates	4|5
a situation where you get the right sort of answer	5|15
creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer	4|15
a situation where you get the right sort of answer	5|15
where you get the right sort of answer	7|15
you get the right sort of answer	8|15
get the right sort of answer	9|15
write it down very easily	21|26

++++++6396++++++
Exactly .

++++++6397++++++
oh wow .

++++++6398++++++
so you 're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser , %uh , whatever it is science .
so	0|1
you	1|2
pushing	3|4
forward	4|5
the bounds of theoretical laser	5|10
whatever it is science	13|17

++++++6399++++++
But

++++++6400++++++
which , %um , is kind of interesting considering that that 's not really my thing . . Indeed . Indeed . being an experimentalist , not a theorist .
which	0|1
%um	2|3
is	4|5
kind of interesting considering that that 's not really my thing .	5|17

++++++6401++++++
%um Indeed . oh wow . oh , impressive . But
oh , impressive .	6|10

++++++6402++++++
so are you going to get an article in Nature or something ?
Nature	9|9
you	2|3

an article in Nature or something	6|12
to get an article in Nature or something	4|12
to get an article in Nature or something	4|12
get an article in Nature or something	5|12

++++++6403++++++
%um , actually , I 'm not sure if we 're shooting for op- ,

we 're shooting for op-	9|14
're shooting for op-	10|14

++++++6404++++++
I think Optics Letters is probably the one that we 're shooting for , or else , perhaps , though I do n't think it 's quite that significant , would be Phys Rev Letters .
Optics Letters	2|4
Phys Rev Letters	32|35
I	0|1
think	1|2

++++++6405++++++
%hm .

++++++6406++++++
But , %uh , we want to write a letter , and then a couple articles .
But	0|1
%uh	2|3
we	4|5
want	5|6
to write a letter	6|10
But , %uh , we want to write a letter	0|10
want to write a letter	5|10

++++++6407++++++
yeah .

++++++6408++++++
%hm . impressive .
%hm . impressive .	0|4

++++++6409++++++
And I do n't know how much you know about scientific literature ,
And	0|1
I	1|2
n't	3|4
know	4|5
how much you know about scientific literature	5|12
And I do n't know how much you know about scientific literature ,	0|13

++++++6410++++++
but letters are much more prestigious than , articles .
but	0|1
letters	1|2
are	2|3
articles	8|9

++++++6411++++++
oh , okay .
oh , okay .	0|4

++++++6412++++++
oh , I did n't realize that .
oh	0|1
I	2|3
n't	4|5

that	6|7
oh , I did n't realize that .	0|8
did n't realize that	3|7

++++++6413++++++
okay .

++++++6414++++++
yeah ,

++++++6415++++++
so that 's why it 's actually a big deal is
that	1|2
's	2|3
why it 's actually a big deal	3|10
why it 's actually a big deal	3|10
it 's actually a big deal	4|10
's actually a big deal	5|10

++++++6416++++++
I mean , you know , writing a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis , is , not at all unusual in Physics
Master	14|14
in	24|24
I	0|1
mean	1|2
writing a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis	6|17
writing a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis	6|17
a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis	7|17
of articles based on your Master 's thesis	9|17

based on your Master 's thesis	11|17
is , not at all unusual in Physics	18|26

++++++6417++++++
and yeah . %uh , it 's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all .
and	0|1
yeah . %uh ,	1|5
it	5|6
's	6|7
the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all	7|24
writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all	13|24
a letter that is the impressive part of it all	14|24
that is the impressive part of it all	16|24

is the impressive part of it all	17|24
the impressive part of it all	18|24
of it all	21|24

++++++6418++++++
And what 's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant .
Neil	11|11
what	1|2
's	2|3
actually	3|4
kind of interesting	4|7
kind of interesting	4|7
I thought that this was kind of significant	13|21
thought that this was kind of significant	14|21
that this was kind of significant	15|21
this was kind of significant	16|21
was kind of significant	17|21
kind of significant	18|21

++++++6419++++++
And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that You know , people see the anti phased motion ,
Neil	1|1
And	0|1
Neil	1|2
kept	2|3
writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that You know , people see the anti phased motion	3|25
of the thesis down that You know	11|18
the thesis down that You know	12|18
people see the anti phased motion	19|25
see the anti phased motion	20|25

++++++6420++++++
and it 's true
and	0|1
it	1|2
's	2|3
true	3|4
and it 's true	0|4
's true	2|4

++++++6421++++++
they do in the transients
they	0|1
do	1|2
in the transients	2|5
they do in the transients	0|5
do in the transients	1|5

++++++6422++++++
And I was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature has this frequency in the transients Yes . %eh and not driven .
And	0|1
I	1|2
having	3|4

++++++6423++++++
And , %uh , what happened was after I had turned in my thesis but before I saw Neil again , he went to a conference in Rochester and there this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work , was , that their models could n't show this as a driven frequency ,
saw	17|17
conference	25|25
what	4|5
happened	5|6
after I had turned in my thesis	7|14
I had turned in my thesis	8|14
turned in my thesis	10|14
I saw Neil again	16|20
saw Neil again	17|20
he went to a conference in Rochester	21|28
went to a conference in Rochester	22|28
to a conference in Rochester	23|28
was a big issue among the people who were doing this work	31|43
a big issue among the people who were doing this work	32|43
among the people who were doing this work	35|43
the people who were doing this work	36|43
who were doing this work	38|43
were doing this work	39|43
were doing this work	39|43
was , that their models could n't show this as a driven frequency	44|57
that their models could n't show this as a driven frequency	46|57
their models could n't show this as a driven frequency	47|57
could n't show this as a driven frequency	49|57
show this as a driven frequency	51|57
to a conference in Rochester	23|28

++++++6424++++++
yet their experiments showed it as a driven frequency .
yet	0|1
their experiments	1|3
showed	3|4
it	4|5
as a driven frequency	5|9
yet their experiments showed it as a driven frequency .	0|10
showed it as a driven frequency	3|9

++++++6425++++++
oh cool .

++++++6426++++++
and so Neil then -- Said oh just a second I -- like a week later came to Bryn Mawr
Neil	2|2
a week later	13|16
came	16|17
to Bryn Mawr	17|20
a week later	13|16
came to Bryn Mawr	16|20

++++++6427++++++
and he said , hey Lowell , we got to write this up .
Lowell	5|5
and	0|1
he	1|2
said	2|3
got to write this up	8|13
to write this up	9|13
to write this up	9|13
write this up	10|13

++++++6428++++++
Exactly .

++++++6429++++++
And I was like , well I 've been telling you that Neil .
Neil	12|12
well	5|6
I	6|7
telling	9|10
you	10|11
that Neil	11|13
telling you that Neil	9|13
that Neil	11|13
Neil	12|13

++++++6430++++++
Indeed .

++++++6431++++++
So Cool . Cool . that 's mostly the sort of stuff that I 'm spending a lot of time on now . %um
So	0|1
that	5|6
's	6|7
mostly	7|8
the sort of stuff	8|12
Cool . Cool .	1|5
on now . %um	20|24

++++++6432++++++
Well it 'll look good on your C V , your resume .
C V	7|9
Well	0|1
it	1|2
'll	2|3
look	3|4
look good on your C V , your resume	3|12
good on your C V	4|9

++++++6433++++++
so you might as well spend the time .
so	0|1
you	1|2
might	2|3
as well	3|5
spend	5|6
the time	6|8
so you might as well spend the time .	0|9
might as well spend the time	2|8

++++++6434++++++
Yes , well ,

++++++6435++++++
%uh , no , it 's definitely worth doing . %um ,
%uh	0|1
no	2|3
it	4|5
's	5|6
definitely worth doing . %um	6|11
definitely worth doing .	6|10
doing	8|9

++++++6436++++++
and I would have been spending more time on it if it were n't for %uh dealing with the burglary issues oh yeah but that I 've been dealing with .
I	1|2
would	2|3
spending	5|6
more time	6|8
on it	8|10
if it were n't for %uh dealing with the burglary issues oh yeah but that I 've been dealing with	10|30
oh yeah but	21|24
that I 've been dealing with	24|30
I 've been dealing with	25|30
've been dealing with	26|30
been dealing with	27|30
dealing with	28|30

++++++6437++++++
So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park .
So	0|1
you	2|3
still	3|4
living	4|5
in that house	5|8
in the middle of the park	8|14
living in that house in the middle of the park	4|14
in the middle of the park	8|14

++++++6438++++++
Yes .

++++++6439++++++
yeah , okay .
yeah , okay .	0|4

++++++6440++++++
yeah .

++++++6441++++++
I mean the thing that i-
I	0|1
mean	1|2
I mean the thing that i-	0|6
mean the thing that i-	1|6
the thing that i-	2|6
that i-	4|6
i-	5|6

++++++6442++++++
this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to .
this place	0|2
is	2|3
incredibly easy to break into if you want to	3|12
if you want to	8|12
you want to	9|12
want to	10|12
to	11|12

++++++6443++++++
oh .

++++++6444++++++
It 's not a question of whether or not , %uh you know , that was easy ,
It	0|1
's	1|2
not	2|3
whether or not	6|9
%uh you know	10|13
that was easy	14|17
was easy	15|17
was easy	15|17

++++++6445++++++
it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into .
no one	4|6
really	6|7
knew	7|8
it was worth breaking into	8|13
was worth breaking into	9|13
worth breaking into	10|13
breaking into	11|13
breaking into	11|13

++++++6446++++++
Exactly .

++++++6447++++++
Exactly .

++++++6448++++++
yeah .

++++++6449++++++
And so the problem is that now they found out that it 's worth breaking into .
And	0|1
so	1|2
the problem	2|4
is	4|5
that now they found out that it 's worth breaking into	5|16
's worth breaking into	12|16
worth breaking into	13|16
breaking into	14|16
breaking into	14|16

++++++6450++++++
yeah .

++++++6451++++++
And unfortunately .
And unfortunately .	0|3

++++++6452++++++
Well , it 's kind of odd .
Well	0|1
it	2|3
's	3|4
kind of odd	4|7
Well , it 's kind of odd .	0|8
's kind of odd	3|7
kind of odd	4|7

++++++6453++++++
They 've stolen very weird things for the most part .
They	0|1
stolen	2|3
very weird things for the most part	3|10
They 've stolen very weird things for the most part .	0|11
've stolen very weird things for the most part	1|10
stolen very weird things for the most part	2|10

++++++6454++++++
%hm .

++++++6455++++++
as far

++++++6456++++++
yeah
yeah	0|1

++++++6457++++++
as a .

++++++6458++++++
The first time they broke in , what they stole was just bizarre ,
The first time	0|3
they	3|4
broke	4|5
The first time they broke in	0|6
they broke in	3|6
they broke in	3|6
was just bizarre	10|13
