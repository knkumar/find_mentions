++++++++++sentence 61+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 62+++++++++++
However , it did not give people such a special feeling as it did this time .

++++++++++sentence 63+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 64+++++++++++
Ah , when an SMS is sent to inform citizens of such an incident , can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ?

Yes , this is indeed through the very successful response to this emergency , ah , by Beijing Municipality , Uh-huh . an extremely good point that is worth pondering deeply , worthy innovation .

++++++++++sentence 66+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 67+++++++++++
For instance , previously our news announcements were made through some conventional methods , but this time it was made in the form of a mobile phone SMS .

24|28	a mobile phone SMS

++++++++++sentence 68+++++++++++
In fact , this is a method highly emphasized in various countries ' development of e-government .

++++++++++sentence 69+++++++++++
We usually make it sound like e-government is something unattainable .

++++++++++sentence 70+++++++++++
Yes , when we talked about e-government in the past , it seemed to be only done through the Internet .

++++++++++sentence 71+++++++++++
Right .

++++++++++sentence 72+++++++++++
It seemed that computers , ah , and the Internet , ah , were an expression of e-government , to let people find out information .
0|1	It

++++++++++sentence 73+++++++++++
Well , presently in fact , e-governments in various countries apply this so - called last multiple - exposure method , such as call centers , such as electronic IDs , and such as , these electronic signatures .

++++++++++sentence 74+++++++++++
These are quite sophisticated forms .
0|1	These
2|5	quite sophisticated forms

++++++++++sentence 75+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 76+++++++++++
In particular , more terminals , such as , this cable television , ah , , this digital television , ah , and mobile phone SMS , are applied in e-government .

++++++++++sentence 77+++++++++++
Hence , I think this is , a test of e-government because , as I remember , during SARS in 2003 , people at that time criticized e-government during the spread of SARS , ah .

++++++++++sentence 78+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 79+++++++++++
They said that e-government was very good but was not put into use .
0|1	They
3|4	e-government
12|13	use

++++++++++sentence 80+++++++++++
Well , this time I think that a short SMS like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through this e-government form .

++++++++++sentence 81+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 82+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 83+++++++++++
We drive often in Beijing , ha , Yang Yang .
0|1	We
4|5	Beijing
8|10	Yang Yang

++++++++++sentence 84+++++++++++
If people were not informed of such a traffic accident through SMS on that day and they continued to head there , what do you think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ?

++++++++++sentence 85+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 86+++++++++++
Ah , well , I think it would have been real paralysis .

++++++++++sentence 87+++++++++++
This is the most appropriate word to use .
0|1	This
2|8	the most appropriate word to use
2|6	the most appropriate word

++++++++++sentence 88+++++++++++
Furthermore , I think that when SMS was used to announce the news , it should be said to have fit the conditions in our China very well .

++++++++++sentence 89+++++++++++
Why is that so ?
2|3	that

++++++++++sentence 90+++++++++++
This is because , it should be said that China is the country with the highest SMS usage .
0|1	This

++++++++++sentence 91+++++++++++
There are probably not as many chances to use SMS in foreign countries compared with domestically , in China , ah .

++++++++++sentence 92+++++++++++
So , it can be said that penetration was quite high this time , by using the most familiar method , most used by everyone , as well as the most prompt and most convenient method , for the announcement .

++++++++++sentence 93+++++++++++
Yes , I noticed that many friends , around me received it .

++++++++++sentence 94+++++++++++
It seems that almost everyone received this SMS .

++++++++++sentence 122+++++++++++
Well , lots of barricade tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of the accident scene beneath the Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road .

++++++++++sentence 123+++++++++++
All personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes , ah , have arrived at their designated locations .

++++++++++sentence 124+++++++++++

++++++++++sentence 125+++++++++++

++++++++++sentence 126+++++++++++

++++++++++sentence 128+++++++++++
Well , it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news .

++++++++++sentence 129+++++++++++
Well , ah , Yang Yang , you work at Traffic Radio Station , ha , well , and we know that you all gave an extensive live broadcast this morning .

++++++++++sentence 132+++++++++++
So , let 's first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident .

++++++++++sentence 133+++++++++++
Judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are the effects ?

24|26	the effects

++++++++++sentence 134+++++++++++
Actually , concerning this , I think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in Beijing .

++++++++++sentence 135+++++++++++
Previously we had a statistic , especially for the ring roads in Beijing .
1|2	we
3|5	a statistic
8|13	the ring roads in Beijing

12|13	Beijing

++++++++++sentence 136+++++++++++
That is , if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as the Jingguang Bridge of the Third Ring Road , it might cause the entire Third Ring Road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jams during these morning and evening peak periods .

++++++++++sentence 137+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 138+++++++++++
It might even impact traffic on the Second Ring Road and Fourth Ring Road .

++++++++++sentence 139+++++++++++
Well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods .

++++++++++sentence 140+++++++++++
Well , we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from Jingguang Bridge to Changhong Bridge from the south all the way to Guomao Bridge , blocking the main and side roads .

++++++++++sentence 141+++++++++++
Well , the situation would be unthinkable during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone .

++++++++++sentence 142+++++++++++
Hence , at that time , before 6:30 a .m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried .

++++++++++sentence 143+++++++++++
However , actually after the entire day today , I came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in Beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam .

++++++++++sentence 144+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 145+++++++++++
However , the affected area was not as large as expected .
2|5	the affected area

++++++++++sentence 146+++++++++++
Moreover , some people made detours once they received the news .

++++++++++sentence 147+++++++++++
Right .

++++++++++sentence 148+++++++++++
Psychologically , people felt quite relieved .

++++++++++sentence 149+++++++++++
Because I know this situation .
1|2	I
3|5	this situation

++++++++++sentence 150+++++++++++
Right , like those whom we interviewed just now .

++++++++++sentence 152+++++++++++
Yes , ah , , a citizen , he said , I set out today before the incident , and I did not drive after I was informed .

++++++++++sentence 153+++++++++++
That person did not even drive .

++++++++++sentence 154+++++++++++
Right .

++++++++++sentence 155+++++++++++
Actually , in this aspect , I think that citizens were really quite cooperative .

++++++++++sentence 156+++++++++++
For instance , this evening , we , received an SMS .

++++++++++sentence 157+++++++++++
A friend said , I work on the 12th floor of the China World Trade Center at the Guomao Bridge , ah .
0|2	A friend
4|5	I

9|11	fewer cars
12|13	everyone

++++++++++sentence 159+++++++++++
Later on , we suggested to him and said , you , ah , might as well take the subway , because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from the China World Trade Center .

++++++++++sentence 160+++++++++++
Right .

++++++++++sentence 161+++++++++++
Hey , he said this was quite a good idea .

++++++++++sentence 162+++++++++++
Actually , I think everyone was quite cooperative and also quite supportive in this aspect .

++++++++++sentence 163+++++++++++
Yes , many , viewers not in Beijing may not be quite familiar , ah , with this road section we just mentioned , where , ah , the accident occurred .

This road represents a main road on East Third Ring Road , with problems on both the main and side roads .

Furthermore , Chaoyang Road is an intersection .

++++++++++sentence 167+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 168+++++++++++
Whether it is Chaoyang Road in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road in the south - north direction , as we can see from this diagram , it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during commuting times .

++++++++++sentence 169+++++++++++
Well , Chaoyang Road is a very important artery in the east - west direction .

++++++++++sentence 170+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 171+++++++++++
When people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road .

++++++++++sentence 172+++++++++++
Hence , if a traffic accident occurs at this place , we can indeed imagine , ha , how widespread , ah , the extent of the impact will be , such as the number of cars caught in traffic jams .

++++++++++sentence 173+++++++++++
Yes , actually I think everyone can see that from the buses that cross Jingguang Bridge .

++++++++++sentence 174+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 175+++++++++++
As buses that cross the Third Ring Road are currently , right now affected by the Jingguang Bridge accident , ah , the latest results this morning show that 32 bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted .

++++++++++sentence 176+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 177+++++++++++
Well , I think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes .

++++++++++sentence 178+++++++++++
If the accident did not happen , perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many --

++++++++++sentence 179+++++++++++
It is really like this , just look at the bus signs .

++++++++++sentence 180+++++++++++
Right .

++++++++++sentence 201+++++++++++
Although the outdoor temperature in Beijing has fallen to minus 3 degrees , the traffic police deployed additional manpower on the roads to direct traffic , ah , and guide drivers in making detours .

++++++++++sentence 202+++++++++++
Well , since direction of traffic was carried out on the periphery , the number of vehicles at the section of the accident was significantly less than usual , with road traffic very orderly .

Ah , it can be said , ah , Yang Yang , citizens , regardless of whether they took the bus or drove , their mentality , in terms of being understanding or calm , ah , was a very important factor in having orderly traffic at the scene .

++++++++++sentence 204+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 205+++++++++++
Right , right .

++++++++++sentence 206+++++++++++
, through your listeners , what kind of feedback did you find out from them ?

++++++++++sentence 207+++++++++++
Actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone SMS .

++++++++++sentence 208+++++++++++
Since we know that Jingguang Bridge is located in the CBD district , well there are many office buildings , ah , a lot of them , as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work .

++++++++++sentence 209+++++++++++
Therefore , they sent SMS saying , hey , it is unusual , ah , for me to be walking to the bus station today or going to take the bus .

++++++++++sentence 210+++++++++++
Well , it is unusual for me to enjoy a very pleasant morning .

++++++++++sentence 211+++++++++++
We then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing .

I think that this mentality in facing emergencies , in one respect shows a great change of mentality that Beijing citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past , and a kind of calmness and maturity after having experienced frustrations .

++++++++++sentence 214+++++++++++
On the other hand , I think it can also fully show the level of people 's satisfaction with emergency mechanisms of the operational departments of the government in handling this incident .

++++++++++sentence 215+++++++++++
That is , they think that the government has tried its best .

++++++++++sentence 216+++++++++++
Well , in this respect , we citizens should also contribute our efforts .

++++++++++sentence 217+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 218+++++++++++
As such , in this regard , I think people 's mentality can become very calm .

++++++++++sentence 219+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 220+++++++++++
Well , Professor Zhou , from this perspective , is this one highly positive effect achieved after information was disclosed ?

++++++++++sentence 224+++++++++++
That is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency , well , it went from a traditionally unilateral administrative management method , well , a method in which information was quite delayed , to disclosure and transparency of information , and very fast as well .

++++++++++sentence 225+++++++++++
We know that in the past , disclosure of information had to be reported to higher authorities , level by level , until the highest authorities had given approval , before information could be disclosed .

++++++++++sentence 228+++++++++++
That is , related information that can be publicized will be publicized first , in order to guide people in what to do .

In this way , related interaction between the government and the people can be formed .

I think in fact , we can sum up many beneficial experiences from this case and actually extend them to other areas .

++++++++++sentence 232+++++++++++
Yes , this is when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic .

++++++++++sentence 233+++++++++++
Traffic was the first thing to be impacted when this , cave - in accident occurred .

However , this accident actually involved many underground pipes , such as sewage pipes , ah , or water , ah , and gas , ah , pipes , that affect the lives of citizens in many other aspects .

++++++++++sentence 235+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 236+++++++++++
Yang Yang , do you know how many pipes there are underground ?

Right now , there should be seven main types of pipes buried underground .

++++++++++sentence 241+++++++++++
Yes , therefore besides our attention to the traffic issue just now , people are also very concerned , ah , with the situation after the accident , with other aspects affecting citizens ' lives .

Well , looking at the government 's response to this cave - in accident , ah , we should say it was very prompt with traffic management and emergency repair , ah , because it involved various aspects of life .

++++++++++sentence 246+++++++++++
Well , ah , Professor Zhou , as this incident involved many departments after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ?

This is also --

It is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up .

3|17	the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up

++++++++++sentence 250+++++++++++
Yes , I think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries .

++++++++++sentence 251+++++++++++
How many groups of people will be sent ?
4|5	people

++++++++++sentence 252+++++++++++
Many groups .
0|3	Many groups .

++++++++++sentence 253+++++++++++
Yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society .

++++++++++sentence 254+++++++++++
It is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified .

++++++++++sentence 255+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 256+++++++++++
How can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ?
2|3	cooperation

++++++++++sentence 257+++++++++++
Well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another .

++++++++++sentence 258+++++++++++
For instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate .

++++++++++sentence 259+++++++++++
However , this time , through the execution of emergency contingency plans by Beijing Municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of Beijing Municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role .

++++++++++sentence 260+++++++++++
Hence , I think this was also a kind of , er , trial of interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms .

++++++++++sentence 261+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 262+++++++++++
It was a very successful , er , response .
0|1	It
2|9	a very successful , er , response

I think many good things can be summed up from this .
0|1	I
2|5	many good things
10|11	this

++++++++++sentence 264+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 265+++++++++++
Yang Yang , based on your understanding , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people 's lives were damaged after the accident , based on your understanding of the situation , how was remedial work carried out ?

++++++++++sentence 266+++++++++++
For instance , it is very cold during winter in Beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently .

++++++++++sentence 267+++++++++++
Er , heating pipes were indeed damaged .

++++++++++sentence 268+++++++++++
Well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of about 70,000 square meters of Beijing .

++++++++++sentence 269+++++++++++
Well , , in this regard , the Chaoyang district government did a very good job .
4|6	this regard
7|11	the Chaoyang district government
12|16	a very good job

++++++++++sentence 270+++++++++++
After it , er , received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent , electric heaters to residents in more than 200 households within this area .

++++++++++sentence 271+++++++++++
It should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday .
0|1	It
5|7	many residents
8|12	quite a warm night

++++++++++sentence 272+++++++++++
Well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly .

++++++++++sentence 273+++++++++++
Hence , over here , I think the municipal government , ah , including sub-district offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households .

++++++++++sentence 274+++++++++++
I think it was done in a very humanitarian manner .
0|1	I
2|3	it
6|10	a very humanitarian manner

++++++++++sentence 275+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 276+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 277+++++++++++
Professor Zhou , actually for such a large scale city as Beijing that has more than 14 million people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common .

++++++++++sentence 278+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 279+++++++++++
I think it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations .
0|1	I
2|3	it
8|11	the same time
12|13	expectations

++++++++++sentence 280+++++++++++
For instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents .

++++++++++sentence 281+++++++++++
Perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before .

++++++++++sentence 282+++++++++++
This is because a city is a gathering place for modern life .
0|1	This
3|5	a city
6|12	a gathering place for modern life
6|9	a gathering place
10|12	modern life

++++++++++sentence 283+++++++++++
It is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict .

++++++++++sentence 284+++++++++++
Hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur .

++++++++++sentence 285+++++++++++
The critical thing is --
0|3	The critical thing

++++++++++sentence 286+++++++++++
But the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents , and for a city , this is a test of its response capabilities .

++++++++++sentence 287+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 288+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 289+++++++++++
Yes , I think through a few incidents that happened in Beijing Municipality over recent years , such as SARS , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave - in at East Third Ring Road this time , I think it can be seen that Beijing Municipality 's response capabilities continued to improve each time .

++++++++++sentence 290+++++++++++
Right .

++++++++++sentence 291+++++++++++
It can be said that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone .
0|1	It
5|11	this time , what was done

++++++++++sentence 292+++++++++++
Um , well , I think , Yang Yang , perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect , ah .

++++++++++sentence 293+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 294+++++++++++
Because you often have this kind of direct SMS exchange with listeners .

Well , Beijing Traffic Radio Station is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade three and above .

++++++++++sentence 297+++++++++++
Well , for instance , as people still vividly remember , at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by Professor Zhou that people still vividly remember , there were no plans .

++++++++++sentence 298+++++++++++
Beijing Municipality still had no emergency plan .
0|2	Beijing Municipality

++++++++++sentence 299+++++++++++
Well , at that time , it happened that I was hosting the Unblocked All the Way program in the studio that evening .

Well , later , when we experienced that rainfall in Beijing , that rainfall two years ago , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner .

++++++++++sentence 307+++++++++++
From our perspective as media , I think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency today , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications , and instructions .

++++++++++sentence 308+++++++++++
Yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city .

++++++++++sentence 319+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 320+++++++++++
That is , this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism must be set up .

++++++++++sentence 321+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 322+++++++++++
In this way , you can manage and resolve an abnormal situation by turning it into a normal situation , without evolving into a sudden public emergency .

However , the question is how city management , er , handles these various kinds of perhaps unpredictable cases .

++++++++++sentence 330+++++++++++
Since we are entering new circumstances of human living , circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urbanized life , well , I think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning , early warning and forecast , emergency response , accident investigation , and accountability .

++++++++++sentence 331+++++++++++
Um , well , based on your understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worthwhile for us to learn ?

++++++++++sentence 334+++++++++++
Although the scale of our urbanization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year , I think , with our economic development being relatively backward , we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries .

++++++++++sentence 335+++++++++++
For instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries .

++++++++++sentence 336+++++++++++

However , we still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure , er , system more standardized , that is , to really implement a system of levels of responsibility .

++++++++++sentence 342+++++++++++
Well , we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances .

++++++++++sentence 346+++++++++++
These also include some of our command and policy - making systems .

++++++++++sentence 347+++++++++++
So , with the growth of urbanization and with more and more of such complicated issues , ah , I think there will be increasingly high requirements on the systems .

++++++++++sentence 348+++++++++++
That is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities .

++++++++++sentence 349+++++++++++

++++++++++sentence 354+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 355+++++++++++
Well , finally , let 's turn our attention to handling of the situation , ah , during the latter stages of the cave - in accident in Beijing .

++++++++++sentence 356+++++++++++
Traffic , ah , can be said to have been directed , and is basically under control now .

++++++++++sentence 357+++++++++++
Well , following this , repairs have to be made on this road section where the accident occurred , including for many pipes .

2|9	Yang Yang , based on your understanding

7|9	your understanding
13|14	it

++++++++++sentence 359+++++++++++
I think that the time really depends on how the overall repair goes .

This is because exploration , assessment , and repair are carried out in succession .
0|1	This
3|9	exploration , assessment , and repair
13|14	succession

++++++++++sentence 361+++++++++++
Therefore , regarding this work progress , to repair this road section in the shortest time , um , this will depend on the work progress .

++++++++++sentence 362+++++++++++
Uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 363+++++++++++
This is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone .

++++++++++sentence 364+++++++++++
There is also an issue with many of the pipes below .

++++++++++sentence 365+++++++++++
Yes , the pipes below .
2|5	the pipes below
2|4	the pipes

++++++++++sentence 366+++++++++++
Right , as it is winter , we know that carrying out construction during winter , especially that which requires pouring concrete and then --

++++++++++sentence 367+++++++++++
Moreover , it is especially difficult for concrete to set during winter .

++++++++++sentence 368+++++++++++
Yes , preparation mix for making it dry faster , has already been added .

++++++++++sentence 369+++++++++++
But in the end , it requires time .

++++++++++sentence 370+++++++++++
Hence , it depends very much on factors like temperature .

++++++++++sentence 371+++++++++++
Just now , you mentioned that there are many pipes , ah , for instance , there is a key heating pipeline .

++++++++++sentence 372+++++++++++
The first thing is to ensure that it is connected in time .
0|3	The first thing

If we actually use 120 million as the statistic for the group who leave the country to work in the city , , at least half of them are um , married before they work in the city .

Since they move from place to place in the city to work all year round , parents of left - behind children have little communication with their children .

++++++++++sentence 1882+++++++++++
While for temporary custodians , they are only limited to providing superficial care , such as making sure the children have food and stay warm , but can not fulfill the responsibility of educating the children .

++++++++++sentence 1883+++++++++++

However , contrary to our belief that they could talk on the phone for a long time when they called , approximately 50 percent of the left - behind children we surveyed talked on the phone with their parents for three minutes or so .

++++++++++sentence 1889+++++++++++
What could they talk about in three minutes ?

However , the parents may not have realized this .

++++++++++sentence 1900+++++++++++

However , a lot of the work that the parents engaged in is dangerous work , including coalmines , construction , and some others , many of them are dangerous jobs .

++++++++++sentence 1920+++++++++++
Thus , I believe the parents of these left - behind children also choose not to take the initiative and tell them the nature of their job .

++++++++++sentence 1921+++++++++++
Why do they do that ?
2|3	they
4|5	that

++++++++++sentence 1922+++++++++++

++++++++++sentence 1948+++++++++++
However , 51 percent of the children we surveyed were unwilling to go to the city with their parents , go to the city , to live in the city .

++++++++++sentence 1949+++++++++++
However , they all wanted their parents to come back , but half of the children did not want to go to the city .

++++++++++sentence 1950+++++++++++
We also asked them why they did not want to go to the city .

++++++++++sentence 1951+++++++++++

However , with the reality that they have to face , I believe that they can not solve this problem .

++++++++++sentence 1963+++++++++++
Of course , we know what the reality is .

++++++++++sentence 1964+++++++++++

They also have to consider whether their children can go to school in the city .

++++++++++sentence 1982+++++++++++
For example , some have just gone for a year , while others have gone for 10 years already .

++++++++++sentence 1983+++++++++++
In this case , um , generally speaking , uh , we did not conduct any psychological testing or comparison in this psychological aspect .

++++++++++sentence 1984+++++++++++
However , many schools and custodians reported that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn .

One only has to recall the bombing of the US Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 , also a month before presidential election , also at a time when Israel was involving suitable ferment at that point in Lebanon now with the Palestinians , where the United States was also attempting actively to provide some stabilizing influence and unfortunately and tragically got caught up in the maelstrom and that seems to be the salient fact of this attack .

He said exactly what the Indians wanted to hear , which is that the dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan should be solved bilaterally and that there should be no outside interference , as he put it in this question .

++++++++++sentence 3086+++++++++++
Now this is something the Indians have been saying all along .

++++++++++sentence 3087+++++++++++
Of course , Pakistan wants international attention focussed on Kashmir , and Mr. Putin also said that he supports India 's tough approach to the external violence in Kashmir as he described it .

++++++++++sentence 3088+++++++++++
This is another thing that the Indians were glad to hear him say , and he also said that both India and Russia suffer from the same sort of terrorism , as he put it , referring of course to the separatist militancies in Chechnya and Russia and in Jammu and Kashmir .

++++++++++sentence 3089+++++++++++
So on balance I do n't think that the Indians heard anything from Mr. Putin that they did not want to hear .

++++++++++sentence 3090+++++++++++
What sort of hold does Russia have on India and Pakistan ?
3|4	hold
5|6	Russia
8|11	India and Pakistan

++++++++++sentence 3091+++++++++++
Russia has very little influence with Pakistan , but of course Russia supplies India with 70 % of its military hardware and that was of course the second pillar here of Mr. Putin 's visit , which was to finalize some very substantial arms deals .

++++++++++sentence 3092+++++++++++
In fact , we 're hearing that those deals have now been finalized , that Russia will sell India 300 tanks , T - 90 tanks , very advanced tanks , that Russia will also sell to India some Sukoi - 30 bombers , fighter - bombers .

++++++++++sentence 3093+++++++++++
They are going to allow India to assemble about 140 of these bombers here in India , and they are also going to finalize a deal whereby India will acquire the Admiral Gorshkov .
0|1	They

++++++++++sentence 3094+++++++++++
That 's an old Russian aircraft carrier that India has wanted to get for some time because India only has one other aircraft carrier , and this carrier in particular would allow the Indian Navy to extend its strategic strength much farther than it currently can now .

++++++++++sentence 3095+++++++++++
So indeed Russia does have quite a bit of influence here .

++++++++++sentence 3096+++++++++++

That 's an interesting question because Vladimir Putin on Wednesday addressed the Indian Parliament just as Bill Clinton had done six months ago , and I think it 's safe to say that Mr. Putin actually probably accomplished more than Mr. Clinton did in the hard concrete terms of arms sales and that sort of thing , but it was Mr. Clinton that stole the Indian lawmakers ' hearts .

++++++++++sentence 3107+++++++++++
Of course you will recall when he spoke to the parliament there was an ecstatic welcome for him .

++++++++++sentence 3108+++++++++++
The Indian lawmakers were sort of clambering over each other to shake his hand as he left the parliament building .

++++++++++sentence 3109+++++++++++
There was none of that for Mr. Putin , but he did receive a very warm welcome , although most ordinary Indians who were actually rather captivated by Mr. Clinton 's visit did not really pay much attention to Mr. Putin 's visit .

++++++++++sentence 3110+++++++++++
In fact his visit has somewhat been ignored and in fact the main news story here in India has been sort of a local controversy over the roll - back of fuel prices rather than Mr. Putin 's visit , but he did do what he had to do and he certainly strengthened ties in a strategic sense between Russia and India .

The detection chip does not simply determine whether a person is infected with enterovirus , but can also differentiate between different virus groups , for instance showing whether a sample contains the deadly Entero 71 virus , or Coxsackie A16 , which is easily confused with Entero 71 .

++++++++++sentence 3577+++++++++++
In addition , the chip and its accompanying PCR kit greatly reduce the time required for testing .

++++++++++sentence 3578+++++++++++
Wang Shin - hwan notes that traditional bacterial and viral cultures take seven to ten days to prepare , and even with the newer molecular biology testing techniques it takes three days to get a result .

++++++++++sentence 3579+++++++++++
But DR. Chip has developed methods to reduce the sample preparation time , which enables a result to be obtained in only six hours when used in combination with their enterovirus chip .

++++++++++sentence 3580+++++++++++
Furthermore , the initial results of joint trials by DR. Chip , Chang Gung University and National Cheng Kung University suggest that the chip is over a thousand times more sensitive than traditional test methods .

++++++++++sentence 3581+++++++++++
" In addition to enterovirus , we plan to develop chips to detect other infectious diseases such as hepatitis B , hepatitis C and HIV , " says Wang Shin - hwan .

Can Taiwan really repeat its success in the semiconductor industry , to become a major production center for biochips ?

++++++++++sentence 3635+++++++++++
BMEC director Johnsee Lee observes that the level of scientific and technical know - how required for biochip production is very high , so that the opportunities for contract manufacture are limited .

However , due to Taiwan 's early entry into biochip research and development , and the high state of development of its semiconductor industry , the island is well supplied with relevant technology and skills .

++++++++++sentence 3637+++++++++++
Thus , says Lee , " Taiwan should have opportunities to enter this field not merely as a contract manufacturer . "

Apart from the fact that the technology is not yet mature , and that generally accepted , mutually compatible international standards have not yet emerged , the biggest bottleneck for biochips at the moment is the many thousands of patents which have been taken out in the field , which limit the avenues available to each player .

++++++++++sentence 3640+++++++++++
" Because this area is a patents minefield , it 's impossible to create a product which from start to finish does n't infringe on anyone else 's patents , " says Johnsee Lee .

++++++++++sentence 3641+++++++++++
In his view , this problem may be resolved in the future by the exchange of patented technologies between players .

++++++++++sentence 3642+++++++++++
In other words , at this stage companies must actively carry out research and development , and obtain international patents , in order to have bargaining chips in future negotiations .

Equally , to have a really broad market biochips need to go beyond the laboratory researcher , and into hospitals , clinics and homes , and to individual users .

++++++++++sentence 3650+++++++++++
Lee points out that before biochips will be worth commercializing , sample preparation needs to be made convenient , reading results must be simple and easy , the chips ' speed and accuracy must be high , and their cost must be low .

With superconcentrates , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine , believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry .

P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience .

++++++++++sentence 4088+++++++++++
But P&G contends the new Cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading .

++++++++++sentence 4089+++++++++++
And retailers are expected to embrace the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space .

++++++++++sentence 4090+++++++++++
`` When shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , '' says Hugh Zurkuhlen , an analyst at Salomon Bros .

But with so many brands vying for space , that 's no longer the case .

If the new Cheer sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates .

Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth . ''

++++++++++sentence 5183+++++++++++
The privilege , however , has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only .

++++++++++sentence 5184+++++++++++
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . ''

Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .

Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good - faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .

++++++++++sentence 6185+++++++++++
yeah .

++++++++++sentence 6186+++++++++++
And she said the students are just ,

and all of a sudden she 's getting conference papers rejected
1|5	all of a sudden
1|2	all
3|5	a sudden
5|6	she
8|10	conference papers

++++++++++sentence 6190+++++++++++
and she thinks it 's the affiliation .

++++++++++sentence 6191+++++++++++
yeah .

++++++++++sentence 6192+++++++++++
Because she does n't think the quality of her work has changed .
1|2	she
5|10	the quality of her work
5|7	the quality
8|10	her work

++++++++++sentence 6193+++++++++++
Now I have n't submitted a conference paper with the Missouri %um , you know , affiliation yet .
1|2	I

%um , in fact I 'm still officially on leave .
3|4	fact
4|5	I
9|10	leave

++++++++++sentence 6198+++++++++++
If anything came up in the next year we could still go back . uh-huh . %uh you know , for Sam .

++++++++++sentence 6199+++++++++++
Wow .

++++++++++sentence 6200+++++++++++
But I think it 's very very very very yeah . unlikely .

++++++++++sentence 6201+++++++++++
yeah .

++++++++++sentence 6202+++++++++++
But at any rate it was nice to hear from her because she said after two years there now , she %um has come to terms with this ,

10|11	her
12|13	she
15|19	two years there now

27|28	this

++++++++++sentence 6203+++++++++++
and yeah . she 's accepted that there 's a lot of good things in Rhode Island .

++++++++++sentence 6204+++++++++++
And , %um , you know , their life is a lot less complicated ,

++++++++++sentence 6205+++++++++++
and she has more time to be a parent .

++++++++++sentence 6206+++++++++++
yeah .

++++++++++sentence 6207+++++++++++
Good .

++++++++++sentence 6208+++++++++++
And she 's just not going to have the same kind of career that she had thought about .

++++++++++sentence 6209+++++++++++
Ron is working as a financial consultant for , %um , Meryl Lynch .

8|9	weeks

++++++++++sentence 6216+++++++++++
and he said he could n't keep on top of it .

++++++++++sentence 6217+++++++++++
He could n't learn the whole new area %mm . that fast each time .
0|1	He
4|8	the whole new area
12|14	each time

++++++++++sentence 6218+++++++++++
%mm .

++++++++++sentence 6219+++++++++++

and he was diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder .

++++++++++sentence 6221+++++++++++
Which you know , given how far he 's gotten , you know , he got his degree at Tufts and all , I found that surprising that for the first time as an adult they 're diagnosing this . %um
1|2	you

Whatever 's helpful .
0|1	Whatever

++++++++++sentence 6230+++++++++++
Right .

++++++++++sentence 6231+++++++++++
So he found this new job as a financial consultant and seems to be happy with that .

++++++++++sentence 6232+++++++++++
Good .

++++++++++sentence 6233+++++++++++
And then we saw Leo and Julie at Christmas time .

++++++++++sentence 6234+++++++++++

++++++++++sentence 6238+++++++++++
uh-huh .

++++++++++sentence 6239+++++++++++
Now she had a job with an architectural group when she first got out to New York ,
1|2	she

3|5	a job
6|17	an architectural group when she first got out to New York
6|9	an architectural group
10|11	she
15|17	New York

++++++++++sentence 6240+++++++++++
and that did n't work out .

++++++++++sentence 6241+++++++++++
She said they had her doing things that she really was n't qualified to do %ah . and that she really did n't feel competent doing .

++++++++++sentence 6242+++++++++++
And , they mutually agreed that she should leave .
2|3	they
6|7	she

++++++++++sentence 6243+++++++++++
And so she was looking for another job .

++++++++++sentence 6244+++++++++++
And , %um , I 'm sure she 'll find one .
4|5	I
7|8	she
10|11	one

++++++++++sentence 6262+++++++++++
He really looks like Ron .

++++++++++sentence 6263+++++++++++
oh that 's life .

++++++++++sentence 6264+++++++++++
%um , and he looked really big too .
3|4	he

++++++++++sentence 6265+++++++++++
In this picture , he 's three and a half .
1|3	this picture
4|5	he
6|10	three and a half

++++++++++sentence 6266+++++++++++
yeah .

++++++++++sentence 6267+++++++++++
%huh .

++++++++++sentence 6268+++++++++++
%um , but Leo and Julie just seemed , %um sort of happy with the decisions they 've made .

And
0|1	And

++++++++++sentence 6270+++++++++++
Good .

++++++++++sentence 6271+++++++++++
%um , like every
0|1	%um
3|4	every

++++++++++sentence 6272+++++++++++
now is he with a publishing house now ?
2|3	he
4|8	a publishing house now
4|7	a publishing house

++++++++++sentence 6273+++++++++++
Which one is he with .
0|2	Which one
3|4	he

++++++++++sentence 6274+++++++++++
Yes which one %um
2|4	one %um

++++++++++sentence 6275+++++++++++
Well I can
1|2	I

++++++++++sentence 6276+++++++++++
yeah

++++++++++sentence 6277+++++++++++
It 's one of these sort of universi- the public university book stuff .
0|1	It
2|13	one of these sort of universi- the public university book stuff
2|3	one
4|13	these sort of universi- the public university book stuff
4|6	these sort
8|13	the public university book stuff

++++++++++sentence 6278+++++++++++
It might be Hard Core Brace .
0|1	It
4|6	Core Brace

++++++++++sentence 6279+++++++++++
I 'm not sure .
0|1	I

++++++++++sentence 6280+++++++++++

It may be the other one that just took the job with Hard Core Brace

++++++++++sentence 6283+++++++++++
I do n't remember which one .
0|1	I
4|6	which one

++++++++++sentence 6284+++++++++++
yeah .

++++++++++sentence 6285+++++++++++
Anyway , he 's enjoying it and liking it
2|3	he
5|6	it
8|9	it

++++++++++sentence 6286+++++++++++
and they 're doing okay .

++++++++++sentence 6287+++++++++++
yeah

++++++++++sentence 6288+++++++++++
he seems to feel really like he 's doing the right thing

++++++++++sentence 6289+++++++++++
and he is Great still in academic publishing .

++++++++++sentence 6290+++++++++++
My other friend just moved to trade publishing after years in academic publishing

++++++++++sentence 6291+++++++++++
and mhm %um you know . It feels like maybe she made a compromise

++++++++++sentence 6292+++++++++++
but it 's like three times the money as with everything else

++++++++++sentence 6293+++++++++++
so

++++++++++sentence 6294+++++++++++
wow wow

++++++++++sentence 6295+++++++++++
industry and academics %um
0|4	industry and academics %um

++++++++++sentence 6296+++++++++++
Terrible

++++++++++sentence 6297+++++++++++
yeah it 's amazing

++++++++++sentence 6298+++++++++++
and %um You know ages ago I got a card from Liz Gana .
2|3	You
4|5	ages
6|7	I
8|13	a card from Liz Gana
8|10	a card
11|13	Liz Gana

++++++++++sentence 6299+++++++++++
I told you this .
0|1	I
2|4	you this
2|3	you
3|4	this

++++++++++sentence 6300+++++++++++
because %uh you showed us her picture .

++++++++++sentence 6301+++++++++++
yeah

++++++++++sentence 6302+++++++++++
yeah

++++++++++sentence 6303+++++++++++
Crazy
0|1	Crazy

++++++++++sentence 6304+++++++++++
%um and I keep thinking maybe I 'd get in touch

++++++++++sentence 6305+++++++++++
but I have n't done it .

++++++++++sentence 6306+++++++++++
and then I saw in the %um Tufts thing that Ginny Totta you know in the alumni thing is living in the

++++++++++sentence 6307+++++++++++
yeah

++++++++++sentence 6308+++++++++++
So , anyway , how are you doing these days ?
6|7	you
8|10	these days

++++++++++sentence 6309+++++++++++
Things are going very well .
0|1	Things

++++++++++sentence 6310+++++++++++
I think I had mentioned before %uh , that there 's a company now that I 'm working with %um , %uh , which is very much just myself and Guss .

++++++++++sentence 6311+++++++++++
oh .

++++++++++sentence 6312+++++++++++
And that %um
1|3	that %um

++++++++++sentence 6313+++++++++++
No , you had n't mentioned that .

++++++++++sentence 6314+++++++++++
%eh , oh , okay .

++++++++++sentence 6315+++++++++++
okay , so %um

++++++++++sentence 6316+++++++++++
%eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at ,

++++++++++sentence 6317+++++++++++
and you were entertaining offers .

++++++++++sentence 6318+++++++++++
And , %uh

++++++++++sentence 6319+++++++++++
well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to just kind of set up my own company , of sorts .

++++++++++sentence 6320+++++++++++
%um oh . So things are going extremely well .
0|1	%um
4|5	things

++++++++++sentence 6321+++++++++++
So , I had one client who said that he 'd pay me a minimum amount .

++++++++++sentence 6322+++++++++++
You know , he , %uh ,
0|1	You
3|4	he

++++++++++sentence 6323+++++++++++
there would be a minimum amount of work , of about %uh , a day a week for the next two three years . mhm . Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then
0|1	there
3|35	a minimum amount of work , of about %uh , a day a week for the next two three years . mhm . Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then
3|6	a minimum amount
7|35	work , of about %uh , a day a week for the next two three years . mhm . Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then
7|24	work , of about %uh , a day a week for the next two three years .
7|8	work
13|23	a day a week for the next two three years
13|15	a day
15|17	a week
18|23	the next two three years
31|34	all my bills

++++++++++sentence 6324+++++++++++
so I decided that it would make sense to do this .

++++++++++sentence 6325+++++++++++
%um and , %um , I 've been getting substantially more work than then .
0|5	%um and , %um ,
0|1	%um
5|6	I
9|12	substantially more work

++++++++++sentence 6326+++++++++++
%mm .

++++++++++sentence 6327+++++++++++
So I 'm quite pleased .
1|2	I

++++++++++sentence 6328+++++++++++
Well that 's good .

++++++++++sentence 6329+++++++++++
%um , so I have a bunch of %uh work that I need to do on my flat this year .

++++++++++sentence 6330+++++++++++
I 've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time .
0|1	I
4|5	you
6|7	I
10|13	that roof atrium
14|17	quite some time

++++++++++sentence 6331+++++++++++
But , %uh , it should come out this year .

++++++++++sentence 6332+++++++++++
oh , well that 's good .

++++++++++sentence 6333+++++++++++
It should be done in a few months .
0|1	It
5|8	a few months

++++++++++sentence 6334+++++++++++
oh , yeah

++++++++++sentence 6335+++++++++++
I remember So you talking a little bit about it at one point .
0|1	I
3|4	you
5|8	a little bit
9|10	it
11|13	one point

++++++++++sentence 6336+++++++++++
yeah ,

++++++++++sentence 6337+++++++++++
yeah .

++++++++++sentence 6338+++++++++++
So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon ?

++++++++++sentence 6339+++++++++++
%um . I do n't see the finances occurring uh-huh , right . for a while .

++++++++++sentence 6340+++++++++++
%um , actually right at the moment finances are not going real well .

++++++++++sentence 6341+++++++++++
But %ah well . I am working on that one .

++++++++++sentence 6342+++++++++++
%uh .

++++++++++sentence 6343+++++++++++
It 's just But %um %uh , %uh , the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up %ah . %uh , related to a couple of burglaries that I had .

++++++++++sentence 6344+++++++++++
oh , harsh . Harsh .

++++++++++sentence 6345+++++++++++
yeah .

++++++++++sentence 6346+++++++++++
yeah ,

++++++++++sentence 6347+++++++++++
and .

++++++++++sentence 6348+++++++++++
Not a whole lot I can do about that now .
0|4	Not a whole lot
4|5	I
8|9	that

++++++++++sentence 6349+++++++++++
Indeed . Indeed .

++++++++++sentence 6350+++++++++++
have to deal with the situation .
4|6	the situation

++++++++++sentence 6351+++++++++++
And
0|1	And

++++++++++sentence 6352+++++++++++
So that 's what I 'm doing .

++++++++++sentence 6353+++++++++++
Sounds good .

++++++++++sentence 6354+++++++++++
But %um Anyway , %uh One of the main reasons that I 've been such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent has been work .
1|21	%um Anyway , %uh One of the main reasons that I 've been such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent
1|2	%um
5|21	One of the main reasons that I 've been such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent
5|6	One
7|21	the main reasons that I 've been such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent
7|10	the main reasons
11|12	I
14|21	such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent
23|24	work

++++++++++sentence 6355+++++++++++
I 've actually been doing a lot of it .

++++++++++sentence 6356+++++++++++
oh wow .

++++++++++sentence 6357+++++++++++
And %uh , I turned in my Master 's thesis back in May ,

++++++++++sentence 6358+++++++++++
and I 'm actually presently working on , %um , several , %uh , articles oh , okay . Impressive . from it .

++++++++++sentence 6359+++++++++++
yeah ,

++++++++++sentence 6360+++++++++++
actually it turns out that one thing , one little bit in what I was doing , %uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end . %uh , from what I had been reading in the literature .

++++++++++sentence 6361+++++++++++
You see the one very annoying thing about all of this , was my advisor has been in France for a year and a half .
0|1	You
2|11	the one very annoying thing about all of this
2|7	the one very annoying thing
8|11	all of this
8|9	all
10|11	this
13|15	my advisor
18|19	France
20|25	a year and a half
20|22	a year
23|25	a half

++++++++++sentence 6362+++++++++++
yeah .

++++++++++sentence 6363+++++++++++
And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there was n't much discussion .

++++++++++sentence 6364+++++++++++
yeah .

++++++++++sentence 6365+++++++++++
yup ,

++++++++++sentence 6366+++++++++++
yup .

++++++++++sentence 6367+++++++++++
But , %um Anyway , I had been kind of telling him that , you know , from my reading of the literature , I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique .

++++++++++sentence 6368+++++++++++
mhm .

++++++++++sentence 6369+++++++++++
And it made the one type of solution occur , which was seen experimentally ,

++++++++++sentence 6370+++++++++++
but none of the other models %uh , had ?

++++++++++sentence 6371+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 6372+++++++++++
the- ,

++++++++++sentence 6373+++++++++++
I 'm looking at , %um , multi mode lasers .
0|1	I
7|10	multi mode lasers

++++++++++sentence 6374+++++++++++
And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased , %uh , states , where if you look at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser , you get an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency .

++++++++++sentence 6375+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 6376+++++++++++
okay .

++++++++++sentence 6377+++++++++++
if you separate out the different modes of the laser mhm . and look at one of those , you get more than one frequency .

++++++++++sentence 6378+++++++++++
okay .

++++++++++sentence 6379+++++++++++
So what 's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other 's Exactly . %hm . oscillations on these other frequencies .

++++++++++sentence 6380+++++++++++
And %uh With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient ,

++++++++++sentence 6381+++++++++++
but you ca n't find that frequency in a driven , %uh , frequency .

++++++++++sentence 6382+++++++++++
You ca n't find so that it will sustain .
0|1	You
6|7	it

++++++++++sentence 6383+++++++++++
okay .

++++++++++sentence 6384+++++++++++
Yes .

++++++++++sentence 6385+++++++++++
So yeah , that particular frequency according to most models damps out very quickly .

++++++++++sentence 6386+++++++++++
And so you should n't actually really be able to ever see it .

++++++++++sentence 6387+++++++++++
%hm .
0|2	%hm .

++++++++++sentence 6388+++++++++++
The only thing is , that , when you do the experiment you see it .
0|3	The only thing
8|9	you
10|12	the experiment
12|13	you
14|15	it

++++++++++sentence 6389+++++++++++
Got it ,
1|2	it

++++++++++sentence 6390+++++++++++
got it .
1|2	it

++++++++++sentence 6391+++++++++++
I see .
0|1	I

++++++++++sentence 6392+++++++++++
So , %um , I found a simple modification of the original formula , which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty . And in most cases , %uh , insoluble .

++++++++++sentence 6393+++++++++++
But yeah . it gives a driving term .

++++++++++sentence 6394+++++++++++
oh , okay .

++++++++++sentence 6395+++++++++++
So , it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer , you just ca n't always write it down very easily .

++++++++++sentence 6396+++++++++++
Exactly .

++++++++++sentence 6397+++++++++++
oh wow .

++++++++++sentence 6398+++++++++++
so you 're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser , %uh , whatever it is science .

++++++++++sentence 6399+++++++++++
But

++++++++++sentence 6400+++++++++++
which , %um , is kind of interesting considering that that 's not really my thing . . Indeed . Indeed . being an experimentalist , not a theorist .

++++++++++sentence 6401+++++++++++
%um Indeed . oh wow . oh , impressive . But
0|1	%um

++++++++++sentence 6402+++++++++++
so are you going to get an article in Nature or something ?
2|3	you
6|12	an article in Nature or something
6|10	an article in Nature
6|8	an article
9|10	Nature
11|12	something

++++++++++sentence 6403+++++++++++
%um , actually , I 'm not sure if we 're shooting for op- ,
0|1	%um
4|5	I
9|10	we

++++++++++sentence 6404+++++++++++
I think Optics Letters is probably the one that we 're shooting for , or else , perhaps , though I do n't think it 's quite that significant , would be Phys Rev Letters .

++++++++++sentence 6405+++++++++++
%hm .
0|2	%hm .

++++++++++sentence 6406+++++++++++
But , %uh , we want to write a letter , and then a couple articles .

++++++++++sentence 6407+++++++++++
yeah .

++++++++++sentence 6408+++++++++++
%hm . impressive .
0|2	%hm .

++++++++++sentence 6409+++++++++++
And I do n't know how much you know about scientific literature ,

++++++++++sentence 6410+++++++++++
but letters are much more prestigious than , articles .

++++++++++sentence 6411+++++++++++
oh , okay .

++++++++++sentence 6412+++++++++++
oh , I did n't realize that .

++++++++++sentence 6413+++++++++++
okay .

++++++++++sentence 6414+++++++++++
yeah ,

++++++++++sentence 6415+++++++++++
so that 's why it 's actually a big deal is

++++++++++sentence 6416+++++++++++
I mean , you know , writing a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis , is , not at all unusual in Physics
0|1	I
3|4	you
7|17	a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis
7|9	a couple
10|17	articles based on your Master 's thesis
10|11	articles
13|17	your Master 's thesis
13|16	your Master 's
25|26	Physics

++++++++++sentence 6417+++++++++++
and yeah . %uh , it 's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all .

++++++++++sentence 6418+++++++++++
And what 's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant .

++++++++++sentence 6419+++++++++++
And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that You know , people see the anti phased motion ,

++++++++++sentence 6420+++++++++++
and it 's true

++++++++++sentence 6421+++++++++++
they do in the transients
0|1	they
3|5	the transients

++++++++++sentence 6422+++++++++++
And I was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature has this frequency in the transients Yes . %eh and not driven .

++++++++++sentence 6423+++++++++++
And , %uh , what happened was after I had turned in my thesis but before I saw Neil again , he went to a conference in Rochester and there this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work , was , that their models could n't show this as a driven frequency ,

++++++++++sentence 6424+++++++++++
yet their experiments showed it as a driven frequency .

++++++++++sentence 6425+++++++++++
oh cool .

++++++++++sentence 6426+++++++++++
and so Neil then -- Said oh just a second I -- like a week later came to Bryn Mawr
2|6	Neil then -- Said
2|4	Neil then
5|6	Said
7|11	just a second I
13|15	a week
18|20	Bryn Mawr

++++++++++sentence 6427+++++++++++
and he said , hey Lowell , we got to write this up .

++++++++++sentence 6428+++++++++++
Exactly .

++++++++++sentence 6429+++++++++++
And I was like , well I 've been telling you that Neil .

++++++++++sentence 6430+++++++++++
Indeed .

++++++++++sentence 6431+++++++++++
So Cool . Cool . that 's mostly the sort of stuff that I 'm spending a lot of time on now . %um

++++++++++sentence 6432+++++++++++
Well it 'll look good on your C V , your resume .

++++++++++sentence 6433+++++++++++
so you might as well spend the time .

++++++++++sentence 6434+++++++++++
Yes , well ,

++++++++++sentence 6435+++++++++++
%uh , no , it 's definitely worth doing . %um ,

++++++++++sentence 6436+++++++++++
and I would have been spending more time on it if it were n't for %uh dealing with the burglary issues oh yeah but that I 've been dealing with .

++++++++++sentence 6437+++++++++++
So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park .

++++++++++sentence 6438+++++++++++

3|5	a question
11|12	you

And , %uh %huh the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the pre-amplifier of my stereo . Unfortunately , because it 's a nice pre-amplifier ,

++++++++++sentence 6461+++++++++++
it has an off board power supply which they did n't steal , which makes the thing that they **stoled** absolutely worthless .

2|5	the only way
7|10	a dual citizen
12|13	you
16|19	a foreign country

like if I were born in Holland and then had American parents . Then I could be a dual citizen .

++++++++++sentence 7204+++++++++++
But you ca n't
1|2	you

++++++++++sentence 7205+++++++++++
If I would to ask to become a citizen in Holland I would automatically lose my American citizenship .

++++++++++sentence 7206+++++++++++
As far as the Americans are concerned , yeah .
3|5	the Americans

++++++++++sentence 7207+++++++++++

++++++++++sentence 7208+++++++++++
The Dutch could care less .
0|2	The Dutch

++++++++++sentence 7209+++++++++++

0|2	The Dutch

++++++++++sentence 7210+++++++++++
want to be a dual citizen ,
3|6	a dual citizen

++++++++++sentence 7211+++++++++++
that 's fine ,
0|1	that

++++++++++sentence 7212+++++++++++
but the Americans as soon as you ask for another citizenship that act of asking for it takes away your American citizenship .
1|3	the Americans
6|7	you
9|22	another citizenship that act of asking for it takes away your American citizenship
9|11	another citizenship

But all foreign taxes are deductible ,

++++++++++sentence 7230+++++++++++
and my taxes here are fifty percent of income .

++++++++++sentence 7231+++++++++++
So the taxes here are so much higher that , yeah I would never have to worry about it .

++++++++++sentence 7232+++++++++++
Unless you became C E O of the company then maybe like a thousand dollars would be taxable , right ?
1|2	you

3|6	C E O
7|9	the company
12|15	a thousand dollars

++++++++++sentence 7233+++++++++++

Somehow it raises a small amount .

++++++++++sentence 7235+++++++++++
the problem 's going to %uh be Anya 's American salary is taxable here and at fifty percent

so we 're going to owe some money to the Dutch government on her salary .
1|2	we
6|8	some money

and then next year it 'll be eleven thousand .

++++++++++sentence 7266+++++++++++
yeah .

++++++++++sentence 7267+++++++++++

0|1	That
7|9	state income

++++++++++sentence 7294+++++++++++
If you dial in Holland , it 's zero one eight one zero . okay in Holland

Clearly the personal income tax policy has too little effect on controlling wealth accumulation by the rich , and too little impact on improving the quality of life of wage earners .

++++++++++sentence 7613+++++++++++
While this type of tax in China has no effect on regulating the income gap or on " taking from the rich to help the poor , " neither is it beneficial in expanding the working class .

++++++++++sentence 7614+++++++++++
If this tax continues to be collected , it will be working against the original intention behind the income tax .

++++++++++sentence 7615+++++++++++
Clearly the necessity for the personal income tax needs to be challenged .

If we think in terms of humanizing the system , i.e. , helping the poor by letting poor people get rich , we should give low - and moderate - income people a chance to improve and raise the quality of their lives ; the threshold for China 's personal income tax should be at least tripled from the starting threshold of 800 yuan per month , i.e. , to 6400 yuan per person .

++++++++++sentence 7618+++++++++++
That would take it to a minimally humanized level , and then we could really talk about " people first . "

If we really want to give poor people a chance to get wealthy , the threshold for the personal income tax should be tripled .

With anything under this threshold , the poor will have no chance to get rich .

++++++++++sentence 7623+++++++++++
And if we 're looking at it in terms of " taking from the rich , " the problem to be adjusted is definitely not whether or not to tax income but rather the problem of the actual method for distributing China 's social national income , namely how to eliminate the " unreported income . "

++++++++++sentence 7624+++++++++++
The income of the vast majority of China 's rich people is unreported income , and unreported income is a problem that Chinese society will not be able to solve for quite a long time to come ; it is a characteristic of China , an uncontrollable black hole in China 's social oversight .

A household like this can not even continue bearing basic living expenses , and their standard of living will decline .

And should anyone in the household get sick and have to go to the hospital , the family may well find itself in an economic crisis .

And if a family like this wants to buy its own home , that will basically be impossible .

Our production relations are no different from the production relations in Marx 's " Das Kapital , " constantly reproducing a proletariat who can only rely on selling its labor to make a living .

In short , if the personal income tax threshold is set lower than 6400 yuan , it will be ineffective in helping the poor get rich .

Conversely , if the threshold is too low , it will cleanly and quickly inhibit the ability of poor people to get rich .

This is because the former two given " fatherhood " are indeed the most essential factors of the national character and institution of the socialist new China , while the latter two dubbed " son " in this article -- are indeed the ideological outcomes derived after the death of China 's founder Comrade Mao Zedong under tremendous international and domestic political pressures on planned economy and public ownership , which grew into today 's para-system after about 30 years of reform and opening up .

Regarding this , my standpoint is : because the socialism underpinned by planned economy , public ownership and the people 's democratic dictatorship is indeed a really " fresh " systemic thing for China in the mid and late 20th century -- without a model or sufficient experience or theories to refer to , no matter how scientific its kernel is , it is hard not to have certain superficial and local problems .

For example , based on the existing institutional cultural heritage in the human history , we could see : the " father " system mentioned herein has the majority in mind or it is established in the fundamental and long - term interests of the majority , as well as the need for sustainable and sound development of the country , the nation , and the overall society -- while the " son " system mentioned herein is ignorant and sick in the company of such behavioral characteristics as exploitation , fraudulence , pernicious influence and robbery .

++++++++++sentence 7715+++++++++++
So , we can not urge the son to throttle the essentially healthy and scientific " father " system by fair mean or foul without considering the consequences , because there are problems in its practice and development -- such as state monopoly for purchases and sales , lower efficiency due to centralized management , and inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal .

++++++++++sentence 7716+++++++++++
It is because that will not only make the society increasingly ignorant and sick as it violates the rule of benign social development , distorts normal " human relations " and the ethic and prevalent value and the rule of civilization update rooted in it , but the humanity will retrogress as people 's thoughts and behaviors become increasingly ridiculous .

++++++++++sentence 7840+++++++++++
In an absolute sense , the US gas price has +already been cheaper than China 's , and in a relative sense , the US gas price is even cheaper .

++++++++++sentence 7841+++++++++++
In the US , the money you pay for a meal at McDonald 's can fill up more than 10 liters of gas , but in Beijing you can get 5 - 6 liters of gas at most .

++++++++++sentence 7842+++++++++++
The US low gas price policy has undoubtedly led to this country 's excessive use of and overdependence on energy resources .

++++++++++sentence 7843+++++++++++
However , there is more to this matter , the whole world has to share the various negative effects caused by the US excessive energy consumption : global warming , and wars caused by oil , etc.

But with the US gas price including taxes even lower than China 's gas price excluding taxes , you can see how much money Chinese oil companies have made out of this .

++++++++++sentence 7848+++++++++++
If there are no price controls and monopolies , China 's gas price should n't have been this high .

So , on the issue of oil consumption , I think China and the US , the No. 1 and No. 2 oil consumers in the world , are also a funny pair .

From a global perspective , the US gas price is obviously too low .

In fact , gas prices in China are probably not very high , but in order to reduce China 's future overdependence on gas , it may be better that China 's gas prices are higher .

++++++++++sentence 7855+++++++++++
But , the direct result of the gas price increase in China will be the increase of monopoly profits of the monopoly companies .

++++++++++sentence 7856+++++++++++
This part of money will not become the government tax revenue , will not be used for public welfare , and on the contrary , will only make the benefits of those people working at the monopoly department even better .

++++++++++sentence 7857+++++++++++
In other words , the gas price in China is too high in the distributive sense .
